The reason is that they tried to live by nature, solely depending upon nature. We know the we cannot live without nature. Let us find the some of the reason why they were able to live longer,healthy and hygienically. I firmly believe that there is a creator of nature who has organized it perfectly to help humankind live healthier. So much of scientific inventions has deviated man away from nature. The food habits, the living style, dresses we wear. All of these has affected our health which reduces our lifetime. Our Body is like a machine that is designed to be systematic. God has created us like that by nature, It is very well organized. I am not a science student, but I can explain some of the basic things. Initially our digestive system is wondrous mechanism that is supernaturally created by God. As soon as we eat, when we intake food, it is ready to process the digestion. This is not by our order, it is done automatically, I believe it is the control of God. But as the science evolution started, we started developing varieties of colorful and delicious food, Our digestive system is loaded very much and that is the reason there is so much of diseases like Diabetes, obesity etc. The natural foods are harmless, the fruits, vegetables. They don't ruin our health. But these modern spicy Pizzas, burgers and so much. These are that that spoiled our body and reduced our lifetime. MAJOR REASONS ON FOOD THAT AFFECTS OUR LIFE PERIOD : * jun * contaminated foods. *Artificial attractions and colors that affects our body. We can live longer only if we only intake that is natural which has so much minerals without any side effects in future. I would rather live in a forest to eat fruits, vegetables which are moderate tasty and live longer than to devour modern foods that are spicy and delicious and die soon.",2,0,

Engineerings from bio-medical fields have come up with new instruments and technology which made detecting cancer easier. It is the pride of science, that nowadays, a deadly disease like cancer is curable. Apart from technological advancement, social life and environment also play equal role to enhance Human life span. Compared to old times, when people were not aware of proper cleanliness, diseases and infections were common but nowadays, people take special care of cleanliness and hygienes. Roads and drains are cleaned in every due time. Special departments are being made in every area who take care of cleanliness and hygienes.Hence the common infections and diseases which demised people earlier are now no more a matter of concern. Individuals themselves have become aware of their health. On addition, Indian Government has itself taken initiatives named ""Swaach Bharat Abhiyan"" which is helping India to become cleaner and better place to live in.

Major contributiors to this are the steps actively taken by governments to reduce infant mortality and pregnancy mortality rates of women, which were leading to death during pregnancy. Several other factors have also contributed to the increased longevity of individuals like better health facilities available to the people, in general at affordable rates, inreased service rates of ambulances leading to lower casualties overall, an almost elimination of some diseases like tuberculosis etc. Also, social media has played a humongous role in informing people about the daily exercises and routines they need to adopt in order to lead a healthy life. Various forums on internet are used to share such information. Also, the rise of health maintenance practices suh as 'Yoga' have served as a major cause among the masees by making them actively engage in taking good care of their own selves. Various other campaigns for breast cancer, uteral cancer etc. have enabled women to be informed about such diseases and has helped several women to diagnose such diseases in early stages. Companies today also employ annual health check-up policies which help the employees take good care of their own. One intangible aspect that has resulted intoincreased longevity is the rise in income levels of people, in general. Not only has medical assistance become more affordable, it has also led to better retirement planning by individuals which has enabled them to live satisfactorily even post retirement, with sufficient amount of funds to sustain and lead a healthy life.

The rise in the economy and earning capacity has also increased the rise in the health conditions of the people. People in early 80's weren't educated and couldn't afford bills.
