"people attend attend college for various thing such as for ""GAINING KNOWLEDGE"",this is the first and foremost thing and also it gives more MATURITY for a person and what we learnin college reflect's the overall lifetime that we are going to live,because they speak a lot.College life not only include gaining knowledge,it also includes many more things such as friendship,hostel room,cutting the class :-) etc... These type of things cannot be retained once again in our lifetime,(ie)these things happen only once in our life time.So a person should enjoy each and every moment of the college life to the CORE,and it not only includes these things there are also many more things that college will teach (ie),normally the college timings will be more than our school timings,so a person (AS TOLD BY STATISTICS),will spend more time in college than spending time on home,and also each and every second of college life should be enjoyed.A COLLEGE LIFE IS THE BEST HONEYMOON PEROID IN A PERSONS LIFETIME,and also it includes various things.In college we are studying many things FOR OUR LIFE,some of them are TEAMWORK: some of the events conducted in college and during a group discussion and many more things,when done,they teaches us the maening of teamwork and it is very useful for life to be lived,The things that we learn in college will be reflected in our whole lifetime,so i think college is the more important thing for a persons life.and also college teaches us how to live properly in a society,because the things that are learnt in our college is reflected in our overall lifetime,And the college also teaches various things for life such as ""discipline"",""punctuality"",""team work"",""admiration on things"" and also In my case,all of my college staffs are more supportive to me in various things ,not only in ""academic side"",but they are even encouraging me to do yoga early morning,(for keeping me fit),"
"Life is like a game, one must be a player not an audience, play your life rather life plays with you. College or student life is said to be golden life. College is a place where one can find himself, his ability, capacity etc. People attend college not only to increase knowledge but to get new experiences. Study is one aspect of college.

"Knowledge brings confidence and confidence provides a individual better capability to explore his/her potential. Although success of individuals like Bill Gates and Albert Einstein has proved that one does have to rely on formal institutions to have a better carrier. People in India often attend colleges or universities due to social pressures. Pressure from parents, relatives and fellow mates has made college education as a necessasity for youngsters. Arrange marriages are based on the educational qualification of the individual. Some sections of society which consider college education important because of the success it has brought to them. Working parents often force their children to pursue higher education for better jobs and salaries. Parents want their children to be independent and according to them education is the only way to achieve this. This mentality is their in almost every middle class family in India. Youngsters are not able to explore their talents as they are forced to join cources of their parents chioices. They therefore end up in jobs which they find boring and monotonous. Scenario is changing as enterpreneurs are emerging. The number of billionaires hailing from India are increasing. This has lead to higher aspirations among the youth. They are willing to take risks and think out of the box. Many youngsters are willing to take bank loans and invest in their own business. College education no more seen a compulsory requirement. Preference is given to a successful carrier rather than a one with higher educational qualifications from reputed institutes. In coming years we will not be surprised to see individuals coming up with more innovative ideas. Ritesh Aggarwal, the founder of OYO ROOMS is a living example of one such individual having a valuation of 630 crores at a age of 22 years. Not bad for high school passout."
"College or University is the gateway to get higher education and to learn cureent trends. It is true that there are so many reason behind it depending upon particular to go for this but according to me there could be few reason for it, those are as follows:- 1. Those fresher who can afford higher education simply go for it.eg- Any fresher just get into college because their parent want it and can afford it, where as they have seer interest of higher education. 2.For many fresher it is the only gateway to enter into corporate world, to get placed from college or to get eligible for applying other gov/pvt job.eg For many government job you need to be a degree holder as well as pvt job too. 3. Some having research related interest and college/ University provide them to learn about proper research methodology and to get into research field.eg A person want to be a scientist than a good college can only provide them to learn about it. 4. It is a plateform to give proffesional edge to primary education. eg Many fresher get to know how external world is after college and start preparing themself for outer world. 5. Many experienced candidate like work experience returned to university for higer education to give more weightage to their profile as well to get trained about changing trend so that they can beef up themself to sustain themself in present. eg Person choose themself to go college or sometime it is company sponcered like many good employeer having relationshiop with IIM or other premium institue. 6.Student having clear goal about their career and area where they want to go, choose college for particular specilisation. eg Student go for enginnering, medical, art colleges as per their interest."
"College according to what I hink is an institution for further studies . Students attend colleges for various reasons such as experince,future prospects,further education,and some obviously for fun . The age after teenage is the age where u learn n develop new qualities ,learn about ureself, we enter into a open world .We get introduced to new working environment with various different region belnging people as our friends , a new head of teachers n a different way teaching . people think attending a university or a college is now play time for the next 3 to 4 years where they are no longer bound in a time zone of morning 8 to 2 afternoon{ as in school}. We meet new people , make new friends and college friendship last longer becuase the friends we make in college are more mature and like minded . Roaming in groups , going adventures trips etc are few examples of college life . Career preperation and future prospects goes hand in hand but now to the new generation the aspect of learning through college is reduced and main preference is given to wandering from place to place . The purpose of getting into a college depends on the background the person belongs for for example Rich family student will come for enjoyment as the purpose but on other hand middle and lower strata of society people come to learn and broaden u their future propects . people do score high marks in college as if in school , but some just bearely pass . Times have changed so has the generation , bunking classes , missing lectures , bunking the college is now more common as compared to earlier generation . College and universities accoding to me make ure future so one should experince everything through it . thank you"
"Education is must for each and every person in the country. Only through education we can gain more knowledge, experience, exposure to ouside world, etc. Career growth is also equally important. So education is compulsory for career growth. Only schooling does not give more knowledge and exposure, so it is compulsory to attend colleges. College is the place where we can gain get more exposed. We tend to interact with different kinds of people who are our same age. Education at college level is more standard compared to schooling. People attend colleges for various reason :1. Compulsion to get a degree. 2. For career growth and development. 3. To get good job oppurtunities. 4. Family background, ect. There are people who work with only possessing 12th std. But it is very hard for them to come up or grow in the field soon. People who work after completing a degree may posses good communicational skills, technical skills, knowledge and also attain growth sooner. We can take examples of many personalities in our country. A.P.J. ABDUL KALAM Our former president, who is no more. He was born and bought up in a middle class family. He had passion on his studies. How many ever hindrences occured to stop his studies, he was so ambitious and wanted to achieve success and make INDIA a developed country by the year 2020. He was a great scientist who brought a massive improvement in science & technology. He was also recognised by the country which gave him many awards. He is the person who inspired many young people to continue their studies and have a good career. Therefore, college going builds good qualites in us & also provide good career growth and development and more employment oppurtunities."
"EDUCTION and KNOWLEDGE are in relation with each other, the best and the most preffered place of being educated and acquiring knowledge can be a school or a college. in a economic status like india, it is only the privileged people who attend college, as to it has become more of a fashion nowadays to go to college, as people tend to forget the main purpose of being able to study. In the current situation people tend to go to college just because to attain a degree and get married with a certain exceptions of people who work really hard to be successful in life. Many famous and known institutes prefer to educate students in providing good facilities like library, computer labs, practical labs etc, but some the people who really don't value it looses the interest over being a graduate and drops out. Now talking about the topic, why people go to college, let us look back from the 19th century, there were a very few privilaged people who actually went to college and got educated, they also made a very good use of it, example Mahathma Gandhi ji, he was the man who was so privilaged and also made a very good use of education not only for his own good but also for the entire Nation. People in the 20th cetury do still make good use of colleges and schools, but they make use of it in a very lethargic manner, people nowadays go to university to have fun, pass time, spend money by goin to pubs, restuarants, movie theaters, parks not only in their free time but also when they are asked to go to college, this sentence refers to lower, middle and the higher class of the society ,people who belong to the same category of the society also do take colleges lethargically. As a conclusion people who are in an objective to learn something and improve their quality of living will ultimately make a good use of goin go colleges."
"I think most of people attend a college for career preparation because many of don't know much knowledge about it's future,when they attending college learns new things,creativity and they know what's field have you prefer those pepole judge their field succes in their life. I getting boring so I don't much write,so thanks and enjoy life."
"education play a very important role in our life that's why people attend a college or university because they have to learnt more and complete his graduation or post graduation. today in the modern era the education is very important without education we are nothing .education is a medium by which we have to improve our skills and knowledge and many more things and all these things olny provide in the college what we have to do in our life and what is the our aim. college is not providing only the knowledge it provides how to communicate with the strangers and how to make a new thing in a simple method .today only the education and knowledge is most important in our life because without these thing we can not servive in the world ,and in college we learnt the how to improve our knowledge and do many other things .in our past theire is big problem of illitrecy but in the 21century the level of education is going to very high because of education not in india but all over in the world . every people join the college or university because they think about their career and completed his graduation or post graduation degree ,many people join the university because they have to research or make a new thing by that thing people can servive their life very easily.in the ancient time people say college is our temple and we have to go their only for the study. our government make many policy for the education to everyone and it perform veruy effectively by this policy india is going to the very less illitreat and people are educated in india. finally i m saying that people join the college because they have to do new things in our life and many people are try to research the new thing in the world because by the research people get the more knowledge and make a differnt from the others thats why the people join the college or university"
"A person has to be a literate in order to face in this fast growing competitive world. Moreover it is not only enough if we just acquire a degreeand place ourselves in a company just for the sake of working. So, to develop a competitive career one should get placed in a reputed university. In reputed unversities or colleges students are not only taught with the subject matters and methods of scoring marks in examionation, but also as an addition career development, experience, knowledge etc are also taught to the students in order to embark themselves in to the next stage of their lives. If we look in to the draw back of the topic mentioned above, we could find that there's a shortage of good reputed colleges where people can only become literate but unfortunately they could not embark themselves a competitive career in order to face the fast growing world. But the government is also taking measures and steps to increase more reputed colleges to help the students who lost their opportunity to get them placed in a reputed college. Practically speaking recently, an eye opening opportunity was created by our government which opened 1000s of white collared bank jobs for all graduates which helpled to reduce the umeployment in a larger scale. Even though it looks like deviating from the topic, what we could conclude is that Government is taking measures to get the students placed in a good university or a college, but we couldnt say that all students would be placed in reputed colleges or universities. In order to balance it the goverment provides many employment opportunities for the literates. SUMMARY 1. The primary reason for people attending college to become a Graduate. 2. To place themselves in a challenging career in their life."
"Many people will prefer to attend college or university to study their UG or PG courses even though the same can be done in correspondence. Because studying courses is a secondary one. learning the skills, obtaining knowledge and learning discipline is the main purpose for which the people will be prefer to attend the college or university. The people who attends the college or university may be having some other coaching or training other than studies such as Communicative skills, personality enrichment training etc. And the people who prefers to attend the college will also have an lot of opportunities to show their talents. They can show their talents in participating various college and inter-collegiate competitions such as cultural competitions etc., and if any of them having interested in sports that too can be shown in college or university by way of joining in college sports team. They can even seek the job opportunities without putting too much of efforts. Because now a days many companies are recruiting the employees in the form of campus interviews and that helps the people who prefer to attend the university or college to get placement in the good company. They will even learn the way they have to behave with others and they will learn how to behave with each persons at different position. Mostly the people who attends the college will have more subject knowledge than those who not attending the college. Because in correspondence there is nothing to be creative and it lacks the opportunity of learning many things. But in college the study syllabus will be good and there may be some practical training for students such as intenship, industrial visit etc. So as for as me is concerned its better that the people have to attend the college because they can get more knowledge and they can achieve more in various fields such as sports, music etc."
"The reason why people attend colleges or universities is to prepare themselves for the future world. As teenagers, majority of the people do not have any professional experience in the corporate world. Most of the jobs which are available for high school graduates are usually as waiters or bartenders in food and beverages establishments. The experience of working in a company is usually only available for college graduates. Colleges and universities prepare people for the future world through the professors who had first hand experience of being in the corporate world, especially in handling different kind of situations. Professors could give different scenarios that could arise in the workplace, and give different solutions that students can do. So that when the time comes that these college students are in the corporate world, they could avoid doing any mistakes, and even contribute to the development of the company. Colleges and universities also offers on-the-job training, wherein students could experience being in the corporate world themselves, and have the first hand experience of what they could be in the future. Aside from the professors, college and university students could also learn from their classmates and the other people that they meet inside the campus. This would prepare them in the future world because through this way they will meet different kinds of people and different kinds of personalities. They will know how to mingle with others, they will learn on how to deal with different personalities, because in the coroporate world, especially for managers, they should know how to manage different kinds of people. Through their expriences in the campus, they will learn this first-hand, and in the future become future motivators of other employees themselves."
"College and universities are the centers for imparting knowledge. Everybody who enters into a college has to have a definate aim behind investing their precious time into their field of interest, be it academics , arts or sports. Today, several people follow the norm of attending such institutions to meet the society's trend and needs. Some may want to secure a good job, others may want to explore the domain of their interests. Hence, we see that there has to be a backbone behind entering into a college or a university.Often, such universities are centers of academic excellence (research based) and promote multi-cultural environment which leads to global awareness and recent trends in differnt zones. For instance, a musician might want to gain an expertise in their field. He might want to make a career out of it. This can only be achived under proper guidance and mentoring. Colleges provide a candidate with all the required facilities and mentoring at one place. This convivial environment accelerates the output of the student who otherwise would have spent countless number of hours without tantamount results. Jobs require every candidate to have a solid foundation on which the repective institution can work upon so as to break in an employee into the work environment. These comanies would prefer someone who has been well versed with the As and Bs of the doamin they want to work in.Universities help the prospective students to lay such foundations, hence increasing their probability of getting absorbed into their domain of specialization. Thus it can be said that attending a college or university proves to serve the students on various levels, accelerating their growth and imparting knowledge.It contributes to the overall development of an individual, shaping them well rounded in various aspects."
"Right from the childhood,we go to kindergarten,then to schools where we spent the most important part of life which is actually a budding period for us.After this students work hard to get into a good college,as any person has to be academically well qualified ,to be prepared how to face the challenges of the world. Students ,quite obviously attend colleges for their future career and increase in their practical knowledge.There are exceptions to this who may consider studies or knowledge just as a matter of getting a certified degree from the university and may have a different plan as per their family background.These students may have come from a family belonging to politics,or bussiness or a famed celibrity family.Since ,they do have high class background they would consider attending a college a mere forced responsibility. Exception to these comes the common man students would consider studies , technology,so important for their future career.These students try to make use of their each an every moment of their time in college meaningful.They become academically qualified and become a good human resource for country. So,in my opinion colleges are attended by mainly two kinds of group mainly in India,i.e. either he has come up a very effluent family and only wants to get a degree just for a show and does not have any interest in studies,there could be exceptions to these.And the group involves dedicated students who wants to have new experience and knowledge so that they can be an asset to the country."
"Students comes with a open mind to explore in the universities and colleges. There are many people who did not do good work in their school days but done a good job in their colleges, University is a place we learn more and also involve in some of the important programs which helps us in future but, there is a chance to move forword in all the aspect. People are good at all the things after going there we can know many hings which we don't no before where as some attend to grow in politics there some people who has grown like that for an example Devineni Nehuru who rules the vijayawada for time and made his mark in politics. There is a chance in growing in some of the areas which they are interested, people make friends with a high profile people so, that they can somehow benifited with those people it can be any form. But these places shows us the life what we can do and how to overcome struggles. There are some people which I know it is dream that they wants to study in the colleges and universities after entering into these places some may success and some may not. There is a chance to learn for good thing and some many learn which is bad even there are some people in that area also, which we can't see in point and we can also see that in other point. People who are in political cornor are more in this area who are interested and expose to many more interesting things in the universitie. We can see great people like Arvind Kejarwal, Rahul Gandhi and more people who came from these places learnt something and trying to serve people and in the other part we can see Mother terissa, Mahathma Gandhi who also done some service of the great nation India. This how people become great and people may aslo spoil for some reasons which hurts their parents but, we can learn manythings from these who are successed in their life and helped others in the country. Either we can learn or we can creat wonders in the places like this we will be exposed to many areas which we don't know but still will get succes in those areas."
"As technology is improving and being implemented in almost most of the fields today, basic education is manditory to acquire a decent job. Thus, almost everyone has a bachelors degree these days. It has become the basic requirement. Some people pursue these courses with personal interest, some to gain a new experience and build their career while others just to land a good job. The people who attend college to learn something that they're interested in or build their career. In my opinoin, these are the ones that tend to get the most out of the course, learning and knowledge wise. The mindset that you come with affects the level of concentration in class, motivation to work hard on the projects and generally helps you get the most out of the course. For instance, during my first year I was genuienly interested in the subjects and that helped me score well during that term. but as we got into the next semester, my level of interest dropped in certain subjects that involved a lot of coding, as it wasn't in my personal interest. This inturn affected my attitude towards studying in general as failure in coding disappointed me and discouraged me. I eventaully realized that everyone have their own strengths and weaknesses, and my strength lied in other subjects. Thus I focused on the things that interest me and found that I could cope better, score well on those subjects due to my positive outlook towards studying. However, there are certain people who attend college just to land a job or get a degree. In my opinion, this approach affects how much you would actually gain from the course you take up. Attending classes would eventaully seem like a task you have to do more than want to do. For Example, A former classmate and I were discussing our attendance and his reply to my question on why his attendance was so low was that he wasn't interested in learning anything but was just there to acquire a degree. Over the last two years, while I was working, I learnt that your attitude towards things matters a lot."

people attend colleges to get more education and knowledge because more knowledge and good education gives good job and bright future. Attending colleges also teaches more and more about life and one can learn about new people and how to stay with new people learning lessons of life. It is said that true lessons of life are learned in college life.
"It is quite obvious that attending college or university is important for career preparation and increaseing knowledge. But it is also true that people who attend college want to get a degree whether they are interested in learning new things or not. In our country where a people status is judged by his/her degree, it becomes imperative for people to attend college or university. We can take examples of Delhi schools where parents have to qualify test to get their children admissions in elite institutions. In our country degree is given more weightage than talent. In such surroundings, willingly or unwillingly people have to attend college or university. Inspite of this, there are also people who attend college purely to enhance their skills. They crack toughest exams to get admissions in the college or university of their choice. These people enjoy learning new things, new experiences. Colleges and universities provide them platforms to showcase their talent(in any field) and nuture them. They fully utilize the college or university resources to nurture themselves. So, there are different reasons to atte"
"People attend college or university inorder to get idea about how a college or university is. This gives experience which will be helpfull in the future. A student who is studying in higher secondary school will defenetly have thoughts and imagination about his/her college life. So when the students are offered to visit a college or university then he or she will be very much thrilled and excited about this. Taking students to colleges or university brings out good outcome from the part of the students. Not only students , if a person who is poor and couldnt study in college and all because of his/her backgrounds will surely love visit a college or university. It is a good idea to visit colleges or univerisitys before directly joing a college. It will give a good experience. This helps for career preparation and also if a student is about to join in a college then doing these visits are very much helpfull in the future. Some the we see during the first visit of a college then that vision will be in his/her minduntill he joins in any new college. Studying in college is really an important part of a our life. There will be many path in front of you and you should pick out the right one. Its in our hands, we are the one who should choose ourselfs out. Choice is always ours but the result is what matters. After finishing the college and still couldnt get all papers then its a waste of 3 or 4 years. Without getting all papers no job will be obtained. No one will with us that time, we will be by ourselfs. So if the path choosen is wrong then the life itself will get into trouble.This leads to many limitation based on family and even friends. While visiting college try to gather as much information about that college before joining. This will help to know the standerds of that college. Information gathering will surely help in many ways. For this the ain thing required is communication skill, If this skill is there then its easy to communicate and get new knowledge and advance information. This generation is very complicated. In evry arena there are competitors. So it sh"
"For some its knowledge , for some its experience, for some its career preparation while for many (specially in our nation) its the pressure that the society puts them under. The reasons are many but most of the people who attend college or university have, 9 out of 10 times, come out saying that the entire experience has definitely taught them something. Be it how to be a doctor, how to be an engineer, how to be a scientist or whatever the courses today claim to turn you into by the time you finish them. In my opinion attending a college or university is that important phase of your life where you undergo the important transition from being a rebellious teen to being a responsible adult (hopefully a self dependant one as well). Many attend college because of their ambitions and just a high school degree is not going to make the cut if they are hoping to get a prestigious job in a reputed company. A bachelors or masters degree from a famous and reputed college undoubtedly makes your resume look better when placed in front of the corporates making the decision of whether hiring you or not. Many people (specially todays youth) are so tired by the end of their high school that they just want an out (a temporary one). they dont exactly want to depend on their parents forever but dont want to be subjected to the rules and regulatioons of the society just yet either. what they look for is a good three to four year break where they do have something to say when people ask them ""So what do you do?"" but at the same time dont have to slog the way they have in their high school years. so in such cases a college seems like a good option where many people just come to taste the college life , make new friends, bunk classes, participate in extra curriculars and what not."
"In my opinion, people attend college to gain knowledge and discover their potential and capabilities. College gives a platform to explore the various career paths that a person can opt and flourish in. College is not limited to enjoyment and fun, it is a package deal. Some people are too busy with their studies till their 12th because they have to work hard to get into a good college. But once they have achieved for what they worked hard, they can finally expand their boundaries and realise the other fields they are good at and work on developing those. Like engineering students work delligently during their school life. They don't get opportunities to go beyond their books or work on a talent. Someone who is good at dancing, once has achieved his/her target can then work on that talent. People who do good can always make a career in that field. The example of chetan bhagat is very apt. He completed his graduation from IIT and then joint IIM's for his post graduation. He could easily get a high paid package in any MNC and he could have led a monotonous life. Instead he chose writing and and made a career out of it. There are hardly any people specially in india who haven't read at least one of chetan bhagat's books. He is amongst the renowned authors. College life has a lot to offer except exploration various career paths. The college lifestyle is missed by one and all. Children are given freedon because they are grownups. They no longer have to seek for permission for every miniscule decision that has to be made. They become independent, learn to face the world, meet sevferal new people who probably become friends forever, college fests, concerts are things that are missed by eve4ry single person once he/she graduates. college life is exciting and full of adventures. once passed out, mostly life become monotonous. people get busy earning money but they are unable to find time to spend that money or take care of themselves. they get stuck in the vicious cycle of luxuries and money that life has to offer and forget the happiness that is found in having a cup of tea for Rs. 3 from the roadside. Gaining knowledge in your field is last buyt not the least. Finally choosing a path and to excel and specialise in the same, there is not a better feeling than that. We are no longer confused as to which field to pick and what to do. we finally have clarity and a vision as to how to go about it. college helps to find a path and be good at it."
"I believe people attend college or university because of the desire to have a better future. If one goes to college and earns a bachelor's degree, that will ensure that individual of better chances of getting a job. Going to college also means that one will continue learning and improving oneself. Continuous learning also ensures that one will have a better future."
"Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts. It is a very famous saying by Winston Chruchill which keeps me motivating. Now i would like to highlight the reasons why people attend their college or university. First, it is very important to be a good being, going to universities or college give us a chance to gain alot of experience when help us to become a good respectable person in the society. Second,all of us want our dreams to come true. A dream of a person can be to become a scientist, pilot, software developer, etc. So to prusue our careers in this field people go to university.We can to know about new technologies and we come to know about our fiend of study. Our teachers also share us their valuable experience by which we learn something which are not in our textbooks. Apart from studies we gain a lot of experience from the outside world as different type of people come to the universities and we learn a lot of things from them. Going to good reputed universities also make our future secure. We can earn good and can support our near and dear ones."
"As mentioned in the statement people attend colleges or universities for a multitude of reasons but I beleive that the four main reasons stand above all others and they are: return on investments(economic reasons),furthering life goals,fullfilment of societal expectations. People pay for a college/university education mostly so that they can use this degree/diploma/certificate to earn more by finding employment in a company,starting their own concern and applying their skills for monetary services. The economic reason is greater than any of the above. Example a person chooses an engineering course but does not find employment because the job market in his field of study is dull.
