aS'Improved access to healthcare has risen the number of years we live The advancements in technology in the fiel of medicine has not just benefited the rich and the affluent, but it also has trickled down to developing nations. One of the reasons this has happened is because of the availability of generic medicines. Indian pharmaceutical companies have played a major role in improving the access to medicines by manufacturing life saving drugs such as ARTs for HIV patients and cancer drugs at a fraction of the cost of the same drugs manufactured in the West. Even global health institutions such as the World Health Organisation (WHO) distributes generic good quality medicines in developing nations such as African countries, India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh which have been plagued by AIDS, multi-drug resistent TB and other chronic illnesses. Better access to medicines has helped raise life expectancy. In addition to improved access, the WHO is working with governments throughout the world to develop health programmes with an aim to make healthcare facilities available to the poor. They work in tandem with local non-profits, NGOs, village and local governments to implement national health policies and encourage a positive and scientific attitude towards health. This has had a positive impact on the health of people in various age groups and has resulted in reducing child mortality rates, therefore extending the number of years people live. Also, national health programmes such as Obamacare in the United States, the universal healthcare programme in United Kingdom and a more indigenous example and the DOTS tuberculosis control programme have helped improved access to healthcare by providing cheap and free healthcare facilities to every member of the society, regardless of his or her income. This, in turn, has helped people live longer, healthier lives.'

aS"People are living longer now because they are staying fit by having healthy foods like vegetables, fruits, juices. Some people are living more than 100 years because they are doing exercise daily which makes them to live longer. They are following the correct diet whick makes them active always. Some people are staying fit because they are always smiling and make others smile which helps them to live longer. Nowadays both men and women are doing work outs which helps them to stay fit and healthy in today's generation. People are doing hard work nowadays which makes their body strong and flexibile so that they are living upto 100 years. To live long we have to maintain our body and mind equally because if it is not in a balanced state we may suffer from any illness which reduce our life time. Persons doing exercise or any workouts they must follow their diet correctly and also must follow the schedules correctly if they don't follow it it may create any health issues to them which may reduce their life time so it is very important to maintain the schedules with correct time. For example if you take body builders they will maintain the correct diet and correct schedule which makes them to stay fit and live longer. There is a statement that a person who sits for more than 11 hours a day will die within 3 or 5 years so it is better not to sit for more than 8 or 9 hours in a day. Walking is a good exercise for a man which helps him to stay fit and live longer. There is an other statement which tells that clapping helps a person to stay fit and it keeps one's mind calm and relaxed so it is better to clap daily for atleast 20 minutes which tunes up our mind so that we can do any work with enthusiasm and with full confidence. We have to advice our children to clap daily which will make their handwriting good and helps them to be active always. We have to avoid some foods in our diet because the particular foods will cause any damage to the organs which will reduce our lifetime. The foods are aerated drinks like coco cola, pepsi, fanta, mirinda. Then we have to avoid junk foods like pizzas, burgers"

aS'People now a days have a lot of excitement for life.A lot of new things are coming in our lives take it as technology.We are looking forward to the glorious future.People have a desire to live their live with full of happiness with their family to look forward on the future of their children or grandchildren.so as a whole people do want to live more so they can enjoy more with their family,with the technology also.technology has given a new way to life,a new way to see the world differently.Living for long is every single person\'s desire but that only depends how positive you are to your life.The more you want to do something no matter through what you have to go through.Technology brought life when people left their hope.It brought happiness when they were sad and alone,nothing to do for.It gave simple idea to do much work in least time.The invention brought a thought of "What\'s next?" in everyone\'s mind.To be honest people now a days are more dependent on technology let it be simple thing as writing also.the more people are depending on technology the more they form a desire of seeing the next or you can say future in a different way.May be it is technology which led people to see their lives in a different way which made people to look towards the future.Technology never left our hand when people do but still technology can not be as faithful as a person who is with you even for the least time.Certainly,it does help us in almost every aspect of life and may be it is the best as well as the worst invention of mankind.However,There is something more dangerous than technology what I think is "Religion",the creation of mankind which is the worst enemy for the mankind itself.Yet can not be helped,because the people who made it,can not destroy it until they feel so.The word "religion" differentiated people made them of a different world,made them into enemies,led to war zone and so to destruction.'

aS'As we all know,that our country INDIA ,is a vast place to live and it is the amalgamation of different people with different thoughts and mentality,people with different cultures ,traditions and customs.There are also people following different religions,castes and dialects.If we roll back the pages of our history,we will see how we have been living in this diverse country.We should also salute the scientists and all those renowned people who have brought great technology and advancement for the country.If we talk about medical science,it has flourished a lot in the past decades.Earlier,people used to die even due to small illness ,but today medical science has a remedy for every disease.There were times when people were dying because of cancer,tumers and so on,but today our government has constructed seperate hospitals for those patients suffereing from these fatal diseases.Also , we should not forget about the cleanliness that is maintained in the environment which is ultimately affecting our health.If the surrounding in ehich we are living is clean,then we are definately living a peaceful and happy life.Also,the lifespan of the people are also increased.The more we keep our environment clean,we will live a more happier and longer life.We should also show gratitude towards our government that organises training and awareness programmes for every indivisuals on how to live a peaceful and healthy life.The people are given training sessions for doing yoga,morning exercises or morning walk,taking healthy diet and avoid junk and oily food.If we are practising these exercises every morning,it would do a lot of benefit to us and keep us away from all diseasesast but not the least,the advertisements that our shown in the televisions are a major source of promotions from where we can also indulge ourselves in the practise of doing exercises.These are are the areas from where we can get alot of inspiration.So,we can rightly say that that people are living longer now.'

p85
aS'"In general,people are living longer now." The simple reason behind this fact or phenomena is that now-a-days people are more concerned about their health and diet.They are even too cautious about their lives and the development in the science and technology had lead to the inventions of various treatments in the fields of medical science,which is just like a boon for people suffering from several diseases and gets recovered by these mazical treatments.This advancement in the medical science has been like a god\'s miracle,which can give the life to the patients once again.Besides,there are several people doing various exercises and joined various gyms ,in order to maintain good health.As people are very concious about their health, many yoga camps has been organized.The most surprising and great thing for our nation is that our prime minister Mr. Narendra Modi has promoted and organized for the "World Yoga Diwas" for the first time in the history,this really shows how much we all are concerned about our lives and health.I have also seen the craze of the body fitness and health improvement plans among youngsters.There are several number of people who control over their diet and eat only healthy things in order to make sure ,that whatever they eat should not harm to their health and this is what the leading phenomena towards the cause of people living longer these days.In ancient times ,people do not had any advanced science and technology in medical science and people were not so concious about their health and diets, they were just like used to eat whatever they wished, they never concern about the adverse effect of those in their health and there were not much number of hospitals for them to get treated for their health issues, and this fact had lead to their short lives,but now as there is advancement in everything,thus people are living longer now a days.'

Urban areas help more people to live longer because of fresh air, unlike here in Manila wherein there's a pollution and an over populated place.

aS"We have heard that people of ancient ages lived longer. The reason is that they tried to live by nature, solely depending upon nature. We know the we cannot live without nature. Let us find the some of the reason why they were able to live longer,healthy and hygienically. I firmly believe that there is a creator of nature who has organized it perfectly to help humankind live healthier. So much of scientific inventions has deviated man away from nature. The food habits, the living style, dresses we wear. All of these has affected our health which reduces our lifetime. Our Body is like a machine that is designed to be systematic. God has created us like that by nature, It is very well organized. I am not a science student, but I can explain some of the basic things. Initially our digestive system is wondrous mechanism that is supernaturally created by God. As soon as we eat, when we intake food, it is ready to process the digestion. This is not by our order, it is done automatically, I believe it is the control of God. But as the science evolution started, we started developing varieties of colorful and delicious food, Our digestive system is loaded very much and that is the reason there is so much of diseases like Diabetes, obesity etc. The natural foods are harmless, the fruits, vegetables. They don't ruin our health. But these modern spicy Pizzas, burgers and so much. These are that that spoiled our body and reduced our lifetime. MAJOR REASONS ON FOOD THAT AFFECTS OUR LIFE PERIOD : * jun * contaminated foods. *Artificial attractions and colors that affects our body. We can live longer only if we only intake that is natural which has so much minerals without any side effects in future. I would rather live in a forest to eat fruits, vegetables which are moderate tasty and live longer than to devour modern foods that are spicy and delicious and die soon."

p113
aS"People live longer now for several reasons. Technological advancement in dealing with illnesses is one. It improves quality of living by engaging sick patients in their course of recovery. Advertisments as well are rampant in all sorts of media that educate people on how to live a healthy lifestyle. Medication for certain illnesses are also highly available in the market that allows consumers to buy prescribed medicine for their condition. Doctors, nurses and other health providers as well are being collaborative with each one, that paves way for the team to monitor disease progress or healing in a faster manner. Machines that are being used in the hospital as well are well-equipped and maintained to offer high-end service for patients seeking for hospital admission. The sanitation is also deemed with much importance in the hospital so as not to aggravate the condition of sick patients. In addition to that, microorganims are being minimized by continuously abiding to hospital sanitation and policy. Hence by accessible hospitals, available cure such as medication to certain illnesses, skilled health professionals and medical apparatus and continued researches on how to deal with life-threatening conditions, have served their purpose in prolonging lives of people. As such, those factors evidently have helped people who has terminal illness cope up with the best that they can with the available options provided for them. Although healing takes time, it also needs spiritual intervention to get ourselves be attached to reality that nothing on Earth is constant, and even our lives are just temporary and that doesn't exempt us, human beings. Human as we are, we are entitled to face death. And as living creatures, it all boils down on how responsible we are in making choices. From the food we intake to the lifestyle we chose to prolong our life."

aS"Yes I aggree with people living longer now. Nowadays, technology took a tremondous leap from the previous couple of decades and it made the great development in the various areas like medical, enggineering, industrial etc. As the medical innovations took place, we have cured lots of diseases that couldn't be cured previous days like cancers, polio, rabis, small pox etc where people died alot. This medical innovations made the people to cure near death deaseases also. People stated to think in the environmental way where their health as well as the environmental health teaks great turn. They started participating actively in the health awareness programs and in certains activities like gym, yoga, excercise and physical development therapies for physical wellness. For mental wellness they started doing meditation, laughing therapies etc. This is at one end On the other half technology made them to live shorter too. Technology made people to think big live big and act big. In this very sense they started trying vehicles which increased traffic, music beyond limits which made noise pollution, and foremore due to the lack of family relationships, value towards humans decreased which made people to lose humanity and stated encouraging terrorism like mass killing activities. These make the killing more even though people had chance to live longer these case make them live short and sadly unexpected deaths. People are living longer, but they can live more longer if they can take control on the environment, human relationships, technology, personal health ehich will make one to survive peacefully both inner as well as outer. This not only benifits the individual but also the nation which they belong as a part of human resources and the development as they contribue themselves enormously in all the aspects moreover PEOPLE ARE THE NATION themselves."

But keeping in mind the kind of health facilities we have in india , it is a big problem indeed. we have huge number of patients but less beds and facilities in our government hospitals and affording a private hospital fees is no more a matter of joke. In old age a person IS faced with alot of health issues , thereby adding more financial burden to one's family as well as the society. government has increased the expenditure on health and development but india's popullation is huge. it is obvious we love our family memebers and it is difficult to see them going away from us in old age also. but if that person is occupying a bed in a goverment hospital that is not even morally correct may be beacuse of that someone could have led a better and healthy life. Moreover, nowadays youth dont want to live in a joint family. they send their parents in old age home and this is not even ethically correct.they should know what is their responsibilty towards their family and society at large. By saying all these i dont mean that in old age people should die but keeping the social and economic condition of our country in mind it is somehow posing a problem there are various reasons for such extended life span: 1. better standard of living 2. great medical facilties at doorsteps 3. people are more health conscious. everyone love their family so they try their level best taht they stay with them lifelong.they provide healthy environment to them , these days people go to gym or do yoga in such a small age. theyu want to keep themselves FIT AS FIDDLE. So, in general people are living longer and healthier life."

aS'With the recent advancements in medical sciences and technology, one cannot agree more about the increment in the life span of human beings. Various causes, explanations and theories have been widely discussed in this context. Firstly, hospitals and health care centers spread across the globe have had a huge impact on the life span of people. With health advice and medicines accessible for all and that too within one or two mile radius from their localities, people have understood the age old wisdom of "prevention is better than cure". Also, with high levels of technological advancements and higher amounts of research to eliminate deadly bacteria and virus, one can safely assume the life span of an average human being will increase two-fold. Thirdly, the point to be noted is the present day awareness surrounding the world population. hundred years back, people wouldn\'t have had an ounce of knowledge about a common cold or an influenze symptom. Today, even a five year old kid can name the virus responsible AIDS. Understanding the causes of development is complex and very discreet at the same time. Vaccines were developed understanding the effect of the bacteria on animals. As rightly said by many, "necessity is the mother of all inventions". With the necessity to eliminate and eradicate deadly diseases, scientists all around the world have worked and are continuously working to make the world a better and healthy place to live in. In this process, immunization to various bacteria has helped man indirectly to live a long and also a health life. Also, Education can be cited as an important cause of this phenomenon. Education has imbibed people with the required amount of awareness about symptoms of various diseases and this has eventually lead to people preferrring a "precaution over cure" lifestyle.'
