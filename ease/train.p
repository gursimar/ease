S"When you observe in an overall basis , people live longer now not because there are no problems or diseases but because the technology has increased this much that every problem has its solution. Firstly , if we bring into our notice during olden days people were hardly concerned about their life , they just wanted to live for the sake of living because that time the generation was different , they had no aim and no reasons to live . But when we look on the overall basis today everyone has their opinion, their way of living and no one wants to just die rather achieve something and live longer. it was always said that good health always leads you to a good path. before it was difficult for the prople to undersatand but now even from a child till the old people , everyone has realised the importance of good health and the purpose living No one can predict that for how many years someone's going to live but a person can surely increase his life span by having a good health, maintaing his pysique , and having a happy life . resons of living longer is just a simple thing be happy always , reduce stress and for reducing stress best solution is doing excercise regularly ( yoga ) . since people are living longer automatically they get into the fact that yes they have to do something in their life. today their is no age limit for anything. old people who couldnt study in their age are completing their degrees in various forms. and they realise that how much is life important to them. its all about human tendency to begin and proceed in their life in which way. The other reason which can be is reduction in intake of tabacco and alchol . though people intake it but they know their limits and in addition todays technology is reaching the hieghts there is no problem which cannot be cured. The causes of this phenomenon is that as people are living longer the values cultures beliefs etc is still existing in this world. because when you compare a joint family will be more discipline and decent compared to nuclear family .LIVING LONGER is just the matter of thinking. its all about how you live your life , in which way and when you die you know that you have achieved something in your life."

aS'Life expectancy is a statistical average of the number of years a human lives, assuming mortality conditions during a given time period; this will vary according to region and era. In the Bronze and Iron Age life expectancy was 26; the 2010 world average was 67.2. In Swaziland the average is 49.42 years; in Japan it is 82.6 years. The combination of high infant mortality and deaths in young adulthood from accidents, epidemics, plagues, wars, and childbirth, particularly before modern medicine was widely available, significantly lowers the overall life expectancy. But for those who survive early hazards, a life expectancy of sixty or seventy would not be uncommon. For example, a society with a life expectancy of 40 may have few people dying at age 40: most will die before 30 years of age or after 55. In countries with high infant mortality rates, life expectancy at birth is highly sensitive to the rate of death in the first few years of life. Because of this sensitivity to infant mortality, simple life expectancy at age zero can be subjected to gross misinterpretation, leading one to believe that a population with a low overall life expectancy will necessarily have a small proportion of older people. For example, in a hypothetical stationary population in which half the population dies before the age of five, but everybody else dies at exactly 70 years old, the life expectancy at age zero will be about 36 years, while about 25% of the population will be between the ages of 50 and 70. Another measure, such as life expectancy at age 5, can be used to exclude the effect of infant mortality to provide a simple measure of overall mortality rates other than in early childhood - in the hypothetical population above, life expectancy at age 5 would be another 65 years. Aggregate population measures, such as the proportion of the population in various age groups, should also be used alongside individual-based measures like formal life expectancy when analyzing population structure and dynamics.'

aS'Improved access to healthcare has risen the number of years we live The advancements in technology in the fiel of medicine has not just benefited the rich and the affluent, but it also has trickled down to developing nations. One of the reasons this has happened is because of the availability of generic medicines. Indian pharmaceutical companies have played a major role in improving the access to medicines by manufacturing life saving drugs such as ARTs for HIV patients and cancer drugs at a fraction of the cost of the same drugs manufactured in the West. Even global health institutions such as the World Health Organisation (WHO) distributes generic good quality medicines in developing nations such as African countries, India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh which have been plagued by AIDS, multi-drug resistent TB and other chronic illnesses. Better access to medicines has helped raise life expectancy. In addition to improved access, the WHO is working with governments throughout the world to develop health programmes with an aim to make healthcare facilities available to the poor. They work in tandem with local non-profits, NGOs, village and local governments to implement national health policies and encourage a positive and scientific attitude towards health. This has had a positive impact on the health of people in various age groups and has resulted in reducing child mortality rates, therefore extending the number of years people live. Also, national health programmes such as Obamacare in the United States, the universal healthcare programme in United Kingdom and a more indigenous example and the DOTS tuberculosis control programme have helped improved access to healthcare by providing cheap and free healthcare facilities to every member of the society, regardless of his or her income. This, in turn, has helped people live longer, healthier lives.'

The research field is growing at a fast pace and our BRIGHT MINDS ,the scientists are working day and night ,studying the health patterns of people across the globe,analysing the data obtained,which thereby ,provides them a clear picture to decide whether to develop preventive medication or not.APart from the medication field,several high end equipments have been introduced , that provides us a clear picture to study about the human body in detail and identify the causes and also preventive measures.One best example that can be cited for the above statement is that of famous hollywood actress Angelina Jolie,who had her breasts removed ,when she learnt that she had the genetic strains of breast cancer causing organism.She is now able to live a peaceful life with an extended lifetime. Adding on to these medical revolutions,the government of the respective countries are ensuring that they are accessible by any common man.Human resource form the engine for the economic growth of the country.Thus several laws and bills are being passed by the government to provide healthcare facilities,or as incentives to regulate human health.The World Health Organisation , which is the centre for ensuring world health ,regulates the activities of its member countries through treaties framed during their regular conventions.'

aS'"In general,people are living longer now." The simple reason behind this fact or phenomena is that now-a-days people are more concerned about their health and diet.They are even too cautious about their lives and the development in the science and technology had lead to the inventions of various treatments in the fields of medical science,which is just like a boon for people suffering from several diseases and gets recovered by these mazical treatments.This advancement in the medical science has been like a god\'s miracle,which can give the life to the patients once again.Besides,there are several people doing various exercises and joined various gyms ,in order to maintain good health.As people are very concious about their health, many yoga camps has been organized.The most surprising and great thing for our nation is that our prime minister Mr. Narendra Modi has promoted and organized for the "World Yoga Diwas" for the first time in the history,this really shows how much we all are concerned about our lives and health.I have also seen the craze of the body fitness and health improvement plans among youngsters.There are several number of people who control over their diet and eat only healthy things in order to make sure ,that whatever they eat should not harm to their health and this is what the leading phenomena towards the cause of people living longer these days.In ancient times ,people do not had any advanced science and technology in medical science and people were not so concious about their health and diets, they were just like used to eat whatever they wished, they never concern about the adverse effect of those in their health and there were not much number of hospitals for them to get treated for their health issues, and this fact had lead to their short lives,but now as there is advancement in everything,thus people are living longer now a days.'

There is wide range of demand for ayurvedic medicines rather than allopathy.Many prefer these because it prevents from attacking disease and it is slow as well as curing process.People have more medical facilities in allopathy also by importing medical instruments etc. People have a healthy diet routine followed by going to gyms,avoiding unhealthy food etc.This awareness is being brought because country like India has more health issues such as diabetics,BP,heart problems,neuro problems.To avoid all these health conscious is must. During vedic period and ancient times India had many medicines to cure .So they followed healthy diet,fresh food,fruits etc.Even our weather,nature also seems to have care on us like each season the fruits,flowers etc which are grown support Humans.Ex:In summer watermelons are famous becaouse they maintain the body temperature.The life expectancy rate is more in India as we are taking necessary steps control diseases such as vaccinations are provided for jaundice,typhoid. But still the country lacks in health issues because we do not have much medicinal benefits or diagnose the diseases.It is also stated that ayurveda,unani,siddha,yoga etc originated from India but he main problem is documentation of these medicines are low.So we should look forward for the healthy India and make the life expectancy rate more by research and development,creating more awareness to the health .'

aS"Here I go typing... On how people are living longer now .! This essay is based considering on all the aspects of an individual's living . When can a person live longer life ? It seems to be clear that a person can live longer only with proper food habbits.. this doesnot only mean that the person should consume only food prepared at home but can take in food outside within his/her limits which clearly states that he/she must take good food for good and longer life !! The second thing where a person can live longer life is when unwanted tensions are avoided , meaning to say that a person has to undertake problems such a way that it doesnot affect his capability or can solve it in a soft and better way and can even take time or suggestions from others.! The third thing which I would like to suggest for a better and long life is that men/women even in the case of a busy schedule can spend time with things that reduces his/her risk or can make him/her feel free from his/her work . A person is said to be relaxed by working on some mental and physical fitness so that he/she can make him/herself free from fatigue caused . This essay doesnot mean to people live longer but these are a few advise that also part-take for a person to live longer.Interest on various activities such as yoga , craft work , creativity makes a person to think out of the box so that it makes a person not to worry on things nor stree him/herself. An individual must have the capability to manage things either his/her professional lif or personal life . Things are to be thought several times before done. Therefore this is all is what i would suggest for a person to live longer . It includes all aspects such as food habbits regarding health , mental and physical fitness as well which would stress-free a person.This includes both the causes and reasons for people to live longer . People are living longer now does mean that people have the capacity to balance lifesuch a way that he follows his/her routine work properly it can be both on his mental and physical fitness or on his/her food habbits .."

aS"People are living longer now because they are staying fit by having healthy foods like vegetables, fruits, juices. Some people are living more than 100 years because they are doing exercise daily which makes them to live longer. They are following the correct diet whick makes them active always. Some people are staying fit because they are always smiling and make others smile which helps them to live longer. Nowadays both men and women are doing work outs which helps them to stay fit and healthy in today's generation. People are doing hard work nowadays which makes their body strong and flexibile so that they are living upto 100 years. To live long we have to maintain our body and mind equally because if it is not in a balanced state we may suffer from any illness which reduce our life time. Persons doing exercise or any workouts they must follow their diet correctly and also must follow the schedules correctly if they don't follow it it may create any health issues to them which may reduce their life time so it is very important to maintain the schedules with correct time. For example if you take body builders they will maintain the correct diet and correct schedule which makes them to stay fit and live longer. There is a statement that a person who sits for more than 11 hours a day will die within 3 or 5 years so it is better not to sit for more than 8 or 9 hours in a day. Walking is a good exercise for a man which helps him to stay fit and live longer. There is an other statement which tells that clapping helps a person to stay fit and it keeps one's mind calm and relaxed so it is better to clap daily for atleast 20 minutes which tunes up our mind so that we can do any work with enthusiasm and with full confidence. We have to advice our children to clap daily which will make their handwriting good and helps them to be active always. We have to avoid some foods in our diet because the particular foods will cause any damage to the organs which will reduce our lifetime. The foods are aerated drinks like coco cola, pepsi, fanta, mirinda. Then we have to avoid junk foods like pizzas, burgers"

aS"Recollecting the times where our ancestors have stayed in, they had a far more healthier, stable, stress free life than people today. I would like to keep my stance as people lived longer before. the average age has been curtailed to 70 today. it is very disappointing that even with the advancement of technology and research in the field of pharmacy, health related issues and the disesases, people today don't live as long as before The lives have metamorphosed and every person is burdened with a lot of things. Education has taken a toll on student's life in today's world.a person judged on your degrees,marks, percentage, ranks. it defines how serious or committed a person is towards its work. Everyone around starts pestering a student and would expect him to study for hours. He no more can have an ecstatic carefree life, unlike our ancestors. Our ancestors would engage themselves by playing outdoor games like gilli danda, called cricket today, kabadi, sitolya and wouldn't be stuck in front of laptop working on their assignments or television watching sitcoms. the excessive competition has simply imbalanced a child's life and a person is put to stress from the very first stage of life. Reportedly, the number of suicides due to stress has increased dramatically. Stress is one of the major concerns today. it is one of the major reasons for living shorter today. one should strike a balance between education and co-curricular to stay healthy and fit. it is very important to work out and keep one's body fit to live longer. Further more, the introduction of junk food has ruined the diet of people today. People today are so fond of burgers, pizzas amd maggi, that it has become their staple food. they get obese and unhealthy and unwanted diseases are called for, which in turn curtails a person's life. Thus, in general, people are living shorter now."

aS'I think people are living longer now because they are aware of the diseases or sickness that causes early death. They are now living the right way by eating healthy food and doing exercises. Many people are now more knowledgeable in proper diet, what food to eat and avoid the vices like drinking a lot of alcoholic beverages that can affect their health. Another thing is that there are new technologies that could tell what are the nutrients you could get on foods you eat and even tell the advantage and disadvantages of them. Now adays, a lot of people wants to live longer for their loved ones so they took care of their health.'

aS'I disagree to the fact that people live longer now. Unlikely in the earlier days, we get to see men and women live less longer in modern world. Earlier, the life expectancy ranged to 70-80 years but now it has come down to less than 50 years. The amount of diseases and iniquities has go up the ozone level that each day we see people die of cancer, tumor, cardiac arrests and so on. it was just yesterday i was been told to pray for one uncle of mine who was affected with a disease which the hospital officials could not even diagonise the fatal disease. The list does not end there. It goes on and on. The causes due to such early dismissal in life is mainly because of the food intake by the people. The amount of junk food, instant feeding systems, burgers with extra cheese and fries contributes to the above. We see even village dhabas have upgraded to another level but the food which they provide is not much of hygiene and declined sanitary working conditions. also pollution in terms of air, water, soil has gone up to another level where people inhale polluted air and water leading them to chronic water infections, respiratory ailments etc. Also, the people consuming the amount of smoke and alcohol has increased over the years. this leads to major lung disease, cardiac arrest, kidney failures and the list can be expanded. i do not see that people live longer now than the olden times. But the fact that lots of new medicines and curies is being developed every day. Lots of medical experiments as well trial outs make people live longer. Cancer centers and home care treatment which give special care to the patients make it cancer a much curable disease now. Thanks to technology and the brilliant minds of the doctors and researchers all over the world. Initiatives and measures can be taken to prevent the intake of beer. Awareness programs, restrictive use of alcohol can be framed and implemented successfully. I and you can be contribute a lot in making the world a better place to live . Maybe put in hands to make our environment go green, preserve our mother land and son on.'

aS'The statement given above is highly agreed upon. In a general view, we do see alot of people living longer as compared to their older generation counterparts. In the recent years, there is no denial to the fact that people have become more concerned about their health and fitness. The living standard of the people has considerably enhanced all around the world in the recent era. Every individual seeks to make his life better in every way possible due to which we have also observed a growing market for organic and healthy food, fitness centres,yoga classes, etc. Slowly and staedily people have accepted these activities into their daily normal lifesytyle and the benefits are being surely reaped. The Life- expectancy ratio has considerably enhanced over the years in various countries because of the adoption of a more organized lifestyle. Other point worth noting to support the statement and underline the reason is that a lot of countries which were plagued by poverty, lower standard of living and unhygienic contditions have been slowly moving on a developing path wherein conditions have become a lot better as compared to the 20 years past. Steps taken by developing countries such as India in the recent times to develop the nation and the interests of the people therein, in the form of providing better living conditions, hygiene care and reduction of poverty has indirectly increased the life- expectancy rate in India. Similarly, such enhanced living conditions have definitely led topeople living healthier and longer. A famous personality once said,"A healthy heart and a healthy mind are the paths to success". Definitely, a good state of your body and mind rejuvenates the mechanism of the functioning of the body leading you to a longer life. A developing concern by the people, attempts by the countries and adoption of a healhy lifestyle and a few of the resons we see people living longer now.'

What we want in our life is to be happy with our family,our loved ones.The phenomenonal causes which are leading to the rapid increase of lives of people reduces lack of physical,motivational and emotional sentiments when a person from a particular family is no more. The increase in people's physical and mental awareness,a hope to succeed with a healthy life with the family,factors contributing to the use of natural resources effeciently and without harming the environment is leading to live a happier,longer and an eco-friendly life.People now are very concerned about their health.They seek doctarial advice,whenever necessary.They use more natural products and remedies to live longer.Everone wants to live and for it,they want money.People work harder to live in this big world.Rich or poor,whoever it is,everyone is trying harder to survive.Even though there is no scarcity of poverty,but poors are also giving their best to earn money.The environment is not that clean but people nowadays are trying not to pollute it,atleast some people! People live longer because everyone is doing a bit to help it,make our environment a better place to live in.With the impact of higher education and open mindset,people are not only thinking about themselves but about others too.People are helping each other from coping from natural disasters.People contribute clothes,newspapers and other things by which they can help the needy ones.If a disaster arrives,then people's of a particular region are defintely effected a lot.But this nice gesture of people brings a hope to live life further.The impact cannot be reduced,but people may live longer.

aS"People live longer now for several reasons. Technological advancement in dealing with illnesses is one. It improves quality of living by engaging sick patients in their course of recovery. Advertisments as well are rampant in all sorts of media that educate people on how to live a healthy lifestyle. Medication for certain illnesses are also highly available in the market that allows consumers to buy prescribed medicine for their condition. Doctors, nurses and other health providers as well are being collaborative with each one, that paves way for the team to monitor disease progress or healing in a faster manner. Machines that are being used in the hospital as well are well-equipped and maintained to offer high-end service for patients seeking for hospital admission. The sanitation is also deemed with much importance in the hospital so as not to aggravate the condition of sick patients. In addition to that, microorganims are being minimized by continuously abiding to hospital sanitation and policy. Hence by accessible hospitals, available cure such as medication to certain illnesses, skilled health professionals and medical apparatus and continued researches on how to deal with life-threatening conditions, have served their purpose in prolonging lives of people. As such, those factors evidently have helped people who has terminal illness cope up with the best that they can with the available options provided for them. Although healing takes time, it also needs spiritual intervention to get ourselves be attached to reality that nothing on Earth is constant, and even our lives are just temporary and that doesn't exempt us, human beings. Human as we are, we are entitled to face death. And as living creatures, it all boils down on how responsible we are in making choices. From the food we intake to the lifestyle we chose to prolong our life."

aS"These days nothing is impossible, all thanks to our technology and science which has made everything a small phenomenon.Living till the age of 90-95 is not a big deal or probably i should say if a person is alive till the age of 100 years also their is nothing suprising. But keeping in mind the kind of health facilities we have in india , it is a big problem indeed. we have huge number of patients but less beds and facilities in our government hospitals and affording a private hospital fees is no more a matter of joke. In old age a person IS faced with alot of health issues , thereby adding more financial burden to one's family as well as the society. government has increased the expenditure on health and development but india's popullation is huge. it is obvious we love our family memebers and it is difficult to see them going away from us in old age also. but if that person is occupying a bed in a goverment hospital that is not even morally correct may be beacuse of that someone could have led a better and healthy life. Moreover, nowadays youth dont want to live in a joint family. they send their parents in old age home and this is not even ethically correct.they should know what is their responsibilty towards their family and society at large. By saying all these i dont mean that in old age people should die but keeping the social and economic condition of our country in mind it is somehow posing a problem there are various reasons for such extended life span: 1. better standard of living 2. great medical facilties at doorsteps 3. people are more health conscious. everyone love their family so they try their level best taht they stay with them lifelong.they provide healthy environment to them , these days people go to gym or do yoga in such a small age. theyu want to keep themselves FIT AS FIDDLE.

Previous years back there were no consideration about viruses but today every individual is aware of every harmful virus and regarding to that also about its prevention. Proper balanced diet is also one of factor of long living.Today people are very keen about their diet .They go for walks ,gyms and take proper counslling.Many family have their family personal docs.These doctors examine family members on weekly basis. The main cause of long living is literacy also.Today most of people are litereate and have full knowledge regarding diet and all . The opening of various small district and sub district hospitals also proved a boon for people in far flung areas where people cant approach citty hospitals. The introduction of yoga also proved a boon> One hour spent in yoga keeps one away from stress and ilness.The intoduction of government on NATINAL YOGA DAY was accepted by pull part of globe.Manp people got relief from yoga and it has medically accepted that yoga helps in relieving stress and all minor diseases.

aS"LONG LIFE Now-a-days people are planning their life, how to live, how to work, how to take care of every small things in the world. They face their problems whatever happens in life. There are some of the causes to lead a happy life. Some of the causes are given below: CAUSES: 1. NO ADDICTION(SMOKING, ALCOHOL, DRUGS) Now a days people chose every decision on their own. The decision makes the life either it is good or bad. They are away from smoking, alcohol. They are very careful in their health. They maintain it properly not to get addicted in any bad habits. 2. DECISION People take their decision own. So the life will be based on their decision. They take care of their studies and based on the decisions, they are enjoying their life without sitting simply. Their is a healthy competition around the world. 3. NO STRESS Mostly people died because of some healthy problems. Why those healthy problems??? because of stress, tension. Due to stress they won't take care of their health. So they can't live long. In life without a problem it is not life it is like dump. So face the problem with a positive attitude. That positive attitude makes you live longer throughout the life. 4.POSITIVITY: Positivity is the great plus point for the healthy life to live longer. Once the problems get into head, it causes stress, depression, healthy problems etc. Face the problem with a positive thought and enjoy the life on your fullfillness. 5. THINKING: In olden days someone told thinking is the first choice to LIVE HAPPILY FOR LONG TIME OR TO DIE IN SHORT TIME. Based on our thinking, our life will be planned. If we think negative, negative think will happen for us. If we think positive, positivity makes the life happier. 6. LIFE IS SHORT: For humans, life is only once. So we have to enjoy each and every second of our life. Whatever happens in life either it is positive or negative, we have to accept it and enjoy it. With a positive attitude we have to plan our life. TO LIVE LONGER: *Don't do negative thing for others. *Think positive and be positive. THANK YOU!!!!!"

aS'REASONS FOR INCREASE IN LIFE EXPECTANCY: INTRODUCTION: It can be very well inferred from the census that the average life expectancy of people has drastically increased. It has become common to see people with age more than 80 years. Lets discuss some of the major reasons for this improvement. GOOD MEDICAL FACILITIES: The field of medical science has shown a major revolution. Nowadays there are medicines for almost all the diseases. For the diseases that cannot be cured using medicines, there are several surgical methods. Medical Engineering helps in the manufacture of precise surgical equipments. In some surgeries, robots that make use of artificial intelligence has proved to work successfully with greater accuracy in operation than human surgeons. OTHER REASONS: Apart from good medical facilities, there are few other reasons that play a major role in improving the life expectancy of human beings. (i) Food: Earlier days people used to eat food directly from the sources like plants or animals. Nowadays food is processed before consumption. Milk is pasteurized to remove bacteria. Sugar and salt are purified to get clear crystals. Likewise all the food items and water are properly purified to make it free of micro organisms like virus or bacteria. (ii) Neat and clean environment: The environment that we live in is sanitized well by the government. The government also takes efforts to reduce the mosquitoes by spraying chemicals and closing the drainages. Mosquitoes are parasites that are mainly responsible for several diseases like Malaria, Dengue, Cholera, Typhoid, some of which are deadly. CONCLUSION: Thus it can be inferred that the life expectancy of people could be increased day by day with development in technology and cooperation of people in making the environment a cleaner and safer place to live in.'

The role that medicine plays when it comes to saving a life is huge especially like curing cancer which once believed cannot be cured. Now days i get to hear more about open heart surgery but seems like tough but doctors over here in chennai are good. Having a good food habit is the key when it comes to living longer. Taking alhocols and smoking which causes cancer so it should be avoided. Take foods which has got less fat. By doing exercise daily one is living longer.'

aS'people are living longer nowdays because of their awareness. Nowdays we have number of source of ideas by doing which we can live long. Everyone wants to enjoy the life, and we can enjoy it till the last day of our life. So if we have long life then we have more days to live to enjoy. There are many causes like some people like money,for which they will spend there whole life to earn it. They think they will earn money like that and will enjoy later.Medical science is developed very well and we have treatment for most of the health problems. However nowdays pollution is increasing day by day and all we can do is to find solution at early stage. People are doing Yoga which is one of the best way to keep your self healthy. Nowdays we can easily consult with docotor or anyone about our health problems and according to which we make our diet by which you can live healthy life. However dur to lack of foods, lack of money for medical issues many people lives are not so long. But if we care for our health and if we eat healthy food if we do exercise and Yoga and if we take care of everything related to our health we can also live long despite of such polluted environment. Now we have technology, we have everthing which can help us to live long. The only things we need to do is give proper attention to such things. We can make proper time table for such thing, however many people are not in the favour of doing such things. And people who gives proper attention will live long life. We have many examples seeing which we can apply it and live young, live free. We have everything to live long, some people may say that we dont have enough money to such things; But what I can say is doing Yoga at early morning will snatch your money, many research shows that Yoga is very helpful to us to our health. And its not very difficult thing to do. However during early days it will take time to prepare yourself but once you get it then it becomes regular thing of your list. So we can live long and enjoy it.'

aS"According to me, the main REASON FOR THE LONG SPAN OF THE PEOPLE TODAY is mainly due to the drastic improvement in the field of MEDICINE. Hence nowadays medicines are available for all the diseases and mainly there are also many precaution medicines which have the ability to prevent the diseases before they attacks a persons.normally when we take a survive by comparing the rate of life span of the previous generation and the present generation, it will be shocking to know the reality since our life span is decreasing for every generation. Before and all the life span of a human was 100years and later it turned to 90 and then 80, this was made as 70 soon and hardly now the life span of a person is nearly 60 and there are only few who have a long life span.This decrease in level of life span is due to the adoptation of new culture and which also includes their food culture which is totally not suitable for our national. so due to these reasons, man started to face nameless diseases and this leads to sooner death. This kind of health problems were started to be cured by the invention of new medicines and also some times by imported medicines. Apart from everything,sugar,blood pressure,kidney stone and heart attack are the major problems faced by this generation humans. since, all the diseases doesn't have medicines to be cured but they can partialy increase the life span of the humans. obesity is not considered as a disease where many advanced equipments are available which will suck out the unwanted calories and fat out but this precess is also a very costly process. if a person had got any fire injuries means they can immediately undergo plastic surgeries which may bring back their own face are a new one. Thus LIFE SPAN OF A PERSON IS JUDGED ONLY WITH THE MEDICINES AND IT IS ALSO BASED ON THE INDIVIDUALS PERCAUTIONS which they take for their long life."

Nowadays, technology took a tremondous leap from the previous couple of decades and it made the great development in the various areas like medical, enggineering, industrial etc. As the medical innovations took place, we have cured lots of diseases that couldn't be cured previous days like cancers, polio, rabis, small pox etc where people died alot. This medical innovations made the people to cure near death deaseases also. People stated to think in the environmental way where their health as well as the environmental health teaks great turn. They started participating actively in the health awareness programs and in certains activities like gym, yoga, excercise and physical development therapies for physical wellness. For mental wellness they started doing meditation, laughing therapies etc. This is at one end On the other half technology made them to live shorter too. Technology made people to think big live big and act big. In this very sense they started trying vehicles which increased traffic, music beyond limits which made noise pollution, and foremore due to the lack of family relationships, value towards humans decreased which made people to lose humanity and stated encouraging terrorism like mass killing activities. These make the killing more even though people had chance to live longer these case make them live short and sadly unexpected deaths. People are living longer, but they can live more longer if they can take control on the environment, human relationships, technology, personal health ehich will make one to survive peacefully both inner as well as outer.

Many hazards like earthquake,floods,various environmental hazards that have been taken place in olden days causes death of lakhs of people ,where their was no facility of building their worn out parts of body or even many people die due to starvation .In the prsent days, government provide many facilites and free services like first-aid , hospital and even sometimes home to the poor people for their livelihood.

But many of them still give precedence to have a good lifestyle for oneself and for the family.

Earlier days not all people were aware of the healthy facts. They knew food is important to life but in present generation we know which food is important to life and how much food is required to maintain perfect body and keeping oneself healthy. Earlier people used to do hard work and thought that is enough for keeping themselves fit. But the truth is not the same. Moreover we have got many devices nowadays like android watch which tells us about the health status like heartbeat rate, how obese are we ,and many more, for which we are becoming concious and maintaining our health accordingly. Apart from all this , nowadays medical science is improving day by day, disease like cancer also have treatment in present day. According to The Times of India one man is still living with a life span of 120 years, one cannot imagine by seeing him that he is actually of that age. He seems to be like 70 years old person. For the first time in his life span he went to hospital for blood pressure. When asked about his secret he performed yoga in the hospital and everyone wer shocked seeing that. So take adavantage of the present development in science and live healthy. Avoid smoking cigarretes and other addictive drugs to live alonger life span.'

aS"United Nation developed a concept of quantifying Human Development Index using three basic parameters, average life expectancy being one of them. Development of any nation does not only depends on per capita income but actually on standard of living of its residents and this has formed the basis of development of HDI. An average increase in life expectancy years can be seen through records and there have been multiple changes in the society which support this increase. 1. Recent researches show that population below poverty line in India has been reduced to about 12% only which was more than 30% some decades ago. Spending power has increased and hence people utilise this increase in resources to maintain their well-being. 2. Globalisation has allowed MNC's to setup their offices across borders & as per international policies, companies also provide health cover to employees and their family members. This is also an important factor as formal systems have been established which make accessiblity to medical services easier. 3. Government has also taken commendable steps to improve the situation. Government Dispenceries have been opened on large scale which provide better health facilities to poor at affordable costs in just a few kilometers reach. 4. Government also provides health services to its employees as well. Large number of families across India get direct benefit from such policies which eventually increase in nhigher life expactancy. 5. Better educational standards have created better doctors and better researches have generated better medicines to cure dreadful diseases like cancer. Initially there was a huge problem of access to good doctors & medicines. 6. Reach of media through every form has increased exponentially in past decades. This eventually means that now awareness programs reach more people and more people use this knowledge to take care of their health."

aS'"In general people are living longer now" is a very true fact. Living longer has been made possible largely due to the advancement of technology, awareness among people, better infrastructure being provided by the governments , ease of accessibility to medi-care , increasing awareness and campaigns on health and hygiene. The reasons stated above are the broad reasons catering to increasing life span of people of all economies - developed , developing and also underdeveloped. The developed economies of the world are already advance and aware and are continuosly working for the betterment of the its citizens. Firstly , it has been made possible due to the large amount of funds available at the disposal of such developed economies. In collaboration with huge resources and efficient governance , the developed economies are continuosly investing in research programs. With the advancement in techonology and of medical science various vaccines have been produced which have been successfull in eradicating deadly dieases like small pox from all over the globe. Further , with the unrelenting efforts of the UN organisation - WHO these vaccines have been made available even to the remote areas so that the dieases can be successfully eradicated. Secondly , as compared to earlier times , people have become more aware about their well-being and so they too take initiative in maintaining their health. Thirdly , governments are now taking adequate steps to provide better sanitation facilities to the people which has helped in preventing people from contracting dieses like malaria , diarreohea , typhoid , fever etc. The Swatch Bharat Abhiyaan initiated by the Modi government is in furtherance of this cause. There are many other reasons which have led to increase in the life span of people and government\'s efforts in this cause can not be over shadowed.'

Our societey is increasing at a wide range with all the developments made by us are getting us to the situation that we can live longer.Scientists are undergoing thousands of searches in labs so that we can get cures to all the dieseases. We have developed some of the vaccinations also that our body gets immune from the diesease before it is occured. In older times one cant even survive if he or she gets the simple fever but now even have the cure to the fever before it occurs. Thousands of new technological machienes are developed to monitor every simgle part of the human body for the diagnosis. Moreover the transplanting techniques which have been developed have added to the survival rates. One can now even transplant heart, liver, lungs, kidneys,eyebalss etc. mostly every part of the human body can be transplanted for regenuvated. Not only this our doctors have made their name in the surgical section many surgeries that were undergone throught the big procedure of all cuts and stiches is now reduced tu just a simple mark on the body and it is done this lasic treatment has also increased the patients survival rate and the rate of infection is also decreased by this techniques.

We have solutions to every problem and we are able to overcome our problems within minutes and sometimes, we are able to obtain expert solutions to our problems with ease. This development over time is the main reason for the changes we incur now in comparison to the olden days. The main reasons for this development is the awareness which has built up among the people, the desire to grow, technology and digitalisation, acceptance to fast changing environment, need for faster and competent solutions. In olden days, while there was absolutely no technology or awarness, people inculcated natural means of curing diseases and finding solutions to their problems. These solutions by our ancestors are even now in use and are the best solutions too. The drawback these natural solutions had is that they were not swift in their approach and did not have the right specific impact. Improper medical facilities, no communication, no clear awareness about sexual health, unwillingness to adopt themselves to better facilities, no proper knowledge, all these led to smaller life spans of people despite the fact of having healthier lifestyles than the current generation. The current generation has got everything in their fingertips. Technology has blanketed every portion - healthcare, communication, lifestyle, education, etc. People present in all niches are made aware of the different diseases and problems that are prevailing and the solutions are also right before them through the most easily accessible manner. Solutions are there for even the deadliest of them can be cured with the proper guidance and the latest tools.

Dieases such as cancer which used to almost inevitably in death,are now curable,provided they are diagonised at later stage.Also dieases like cholera and tuberculosis cause fewer deaths than few decades ago. Another reason for greater life expectancy is the general betterment of quality of life.What we call the global village is fast becoming a city.SAnd this city more and more pepole are being provided a better level of hygiene.The increase in awarness also mean that pepole in general are becoming more and more aware of the riskls of various dieases.For instance more pepole now,than now two decades ago are aware of the scourge of cholestrol. In general though the increased life expactancy owers more to revolution in communication.It may be mentioned that even two years ago,inventions and discoveries were being made.However they did few pepole any good.The general awarness about health was also low.However it has been noticed that since the inception of communication through first print,and then the radio and television the level of awarness regarding health generally risen In the coming years,we may hope to see an even greater increase in life expectancy,even as communication techniques continues to improve.'

aS'With the recent advancements in medical sciences and technology, one cannot agree more about the increment in the life span of human beings. Various causes, explanations and theories have been widely discussed in this context. Firstly, hospitals and health care centers spread across the globe have had a huge impact on the life span of people. With health advice and medicines accessible for all and that too within one or two mile radius from their localities, people have understood the age old wisdom of "prevention is better than cure". Also, with high levels of technological advancements and higher amounts of research to eliminate deadly bacteria and virus, one can safely assume the life span of an average human being will increase two-fold. Thirdly, the point to be noted is the present day awareness surrounding the world population. hundred years back, people wouldn\'t have had an ounce of knowledge about a common cold or an influenze symptom. Today, even a five year old kid can name the virus responsible AIDS. Understanding the causes of development is complex and very discreet at the same time. Vaccines were developed understanding the effect of the bacteria on animals. As rightly said by many, "necessity is the mother of all inventions". With the necessity to eliminate and eradicate deadly diseases, scientists all around the world have worked and are continuously working to make the world a better and healthy place to live in. In this process, immunization to various bacteria has helped man indirectly to live a long and also a health life. Also, Education can be cited as an important cause of this phenomenon. Education has imbibed people with the required amount of awareness about symptoms of various diseases and this has eventually lead to people preferrring a "precaution over cure" lifestyle.'

The world has developed at a good pace with development of technologies and researches in various field of science. The contribution made in the field of medical science in the techonological aspect is comendable. The chance of survival from a severe disease has drastically increased as of researchers can experimentally test the success rate of cure for any disease using the tech aspects designed for the same. Few examples are: the Laser treatment for skin, kidney stones etc., MRI scans for fast detection of internal damage etc. Even in the field of Medical drugs production, the discovery of new elements and the stabilty of many compounds to produce effective medicines can now be well tested using experimental environment. The Medical Science has now got more medicinal cure which is safe and easy to go through rather than going through the tedious, expensive and painful operations. Such medicainal cure are affordable and any class of people can afford it. Apart from these aspects the Government has also taken many initiative to erradicate diseases which can be avoided at a much previous stage by spreading awareness and organising health camps. Hence the newly borns can be made safe from such diseases. WHO(World Health Organisation) is the major body that looks into this matter. It creates statistical report every year to rate the countries in terms of health and death rate. It also enforces countries under its guidance to take necessary step to avoid any major mishap. No medical way of keeping onself fit is also encouraged by WHO.
