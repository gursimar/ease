S'No i am not agree with this, that the peoples are living longer.Because nowadays the pollution is tremendously incresed.peoples are livng maximum to 90 years.but now the technology is there to overcome the maxmimum problems of peoples. 50-60 years ago there is no such a high or advace technology is used, before 50-60 years ago various medical issues are there or problms are there.but nowadays maximum diseases are cure by medical science.peoples are more aware.'
p59
aS'TODAYS ERA IS THE ERA OF TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENTS. IN EARLIER DAYS DUE TO LACK OF TECHNOLOGY THERE WERE NOT MANY DEVELOPMENTS IN THE FIELD OF HEALTH CARE AND MEDICINES. BUT WITH THE DEVELOPMENTS IN FIELD OF SCIENCE AND MORE TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENTS MORE AND MORE MEDICINES, TREATMENTS RELATED TO VARIOUS DISEASES, EQUIPMENTS AND MACHINES NEEDED FOR THE THESE TREATMENTS HAVE CAME INTO SCENE. NOWADAYS THE HOSPITALS, BE IT BE PUBLIC, PRIVATE OR GOVERNMENTAL, ARE WELL EQUIPED WITH THESE MACHINES. ALSO DUE TO ADVANCEMENTS IN THE FIELD OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION SYSTEM HAS IMPROVED TO A GREATER EXTEND PRODUCING MORE EFFICIENT DOCTORS AND OTHER PERSONNELS RELATED TO THE FIELD OF HEALTHCARE AND MEDICINES. ALSO MEDICINES LIKE THE GENERIC MEDICINES (MEDICINES IN THE THEIR GENERIC CORE FORM) HAS COME INTO ROLE. THE COST OF THESE GENERIC MEDICINES ARE QUITE LOW THAN THE MEDICINES SOLD IN THE MARKET. MOREOVER THE GOVERNMENT HASE BECOME SENSITIVE TOWARDS THE ISSUE OF HEALTHCARE, AS THE DISEASES ARE INCREASING DAY BY DAY AND NEW DISEASES ARE COMING INTO PREVELANCE. FOR QUALITY MEDICAL EDUCATION MANY WELL REPUTED MEDICAL COLLEGES ARE BEING OPENED THROUGHOUT THE GLOBE. ALSO FOR PROVIDING QUALITY TREATMENT TO THE PATIENTS MANY EFFICIENT HOSPITALS AND HEALTHCARE CENTRES ARE BEING BROUGHT INTO RUNNING STAGE. EVEN PEOPLE THEMSELVES ARE CONTRIBUTING TOWARDS THE VERY PHENOMENON. WITH THE ADVANCEMENTS PEOPLE HAVE BECOME SENSITIVE TOWARDS THEIR HEALTH AND TAKE CARE OF THEIR HEALTH. EARLIER PEOPLE IGNORED THE SYMPTOMS THAT THEY GOT TO SEE AND DID NOT TAKE TREATMENT FOR THE RESPECTIVE DISEASE ON TIME. BUT NOW DUE THE ADVANCED FACILITIES AVAILABLE IN THE FIELD OF HEALTHCARE AND MEDICINES AND BETTER LIVING STANDARDS, THEY APPROACH TO THE DOCTORS, HOASPITALS AND CLINICS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. HENCE THESE REASONS HAVE CONTRIBUTED TOWARDS THE PHENOMENA " PEOPLE ARE LIVING LONGER NOW."'
p60
aS'Owing to the improvement in medical infrastructure, medicines for many epic diseases have been found. Not only for that even medicines for different types of cancer have been found. medicines for genetical diseases have found with the help of nano technology. stem cell therapy helps in curing many diseases. Medicines which are not available only in foregin country are now accessed through modern transport facility. there are many live saving drugs available in the market in less price due low cost of production. due to competition many pharamacutical company manufacture medicines at low cost to increase there reputation in the market.'

aS"They are doing regular exercise.They are eat fruits & vegetable . Regular chek up to family doctor . Government facilities .High profile hospitals at emergency . hence peoples life are longer now . whoes the peoples are tension free they are also live long now . In the earlier years because of improper treatments the peoples are die . but in now day's we have a proper & effective medicines on every flue ."
p62
aS'Life is very precious. Leading a long life is not as much important as leading a healthy life. One must use healthier ways to lead their life. People nowadays, have become cautious as to what to eat and what not to eat. They take up activities that improve their living style. Activities such as Yoga, Cycling etc really help in removing toxics from your body. We all know how polluted our environment is, but with awareness and education people are trying to slow it down. People actualy use public transport and do car pool to reduce the air pollution. We see so many new ventures coming up top produce healthy and lean food.'
p63
aS'now a days pepole are living a longer and healthier life then the technology are to be developed. the scientist are research the new medicines of any problem and causes. then technology is fast and digital then the problems are solve earlier. life easy'
p64
aS'people is long time life because very facilites available in people and another thinks that available easy doctors and any deficult solve to doctor to online connect to another solve to problem to people. people are reguler to check up to doctor. people should be regular to morning running to healt is good healt full available to easy medicnen to solve to the problem to people new idea are avialable to medicnen to use to doctor to people'
p65
aS'As the field of Medical science have been developed and improved comparitively in past,which help the people to get cure as soon as posible when ever they are effected by any of the diseases or any other health issues. And the health awares programs are been encourage by everyone in the society,as wel as the government.government takes many measures to have best medical facilities for the people. The present generation people are more of health consious, as everyone wants to be fit and healthy.. Thus due this reasons the people living longer .'
p66
aS"There are many reason for people are leaving longer. several reason for leaving the people are:-the people have no tension that's, why people are living longer and the people who have no addicted to some bad habbit.people have no any type of health problem who lives longer. peoples should helps other person for living longer now.people are living longer now because they use there own product who growth itself. people should want to help any type of problem if he helps other person then he living longer now. peoples have many bad habbites just like drink alcohol etc that's why people not living longer."
p67
aS"Recollecting the times where our ancestors have stayed in, they had a far more healthier, stable, stress free life than people today. I would like to keep my stance as people lived longer before. the average age has been curtailed to 70 today. it is very disappointing that even with the advancement of technology and research in the field of pharmacy, health related issues and the disesases, people today don't live as long as before The lives have metamorphosed and every person is burdened with a lot of things. Education has taken a toll on student's life in today's world.a person judged on your degrees,marks, percentage, ranks. it defines how serious or committed a person is towards its work. Everyone around starts pestering a student and would expect him to study for hours. He no more can have an ecstatic carefree life, unlike our ancestors. Our ancestors would engage themselves by playing outdoor games like gilli danda, called cricket today, kabadi, sitolya and wouldn't be stuck in front of laptop working on their assignments or television watching sitcoms. the excessive competition has simply imbalanced a child's life and a person is put to stress from the very first stage of life. Reportedly, the number of suicides due to stress has increased dramatically. Stress is one of the major concerns today. it is one of the major reasons for living shorter today. one should strike a balance between education and co-curricular to stay healthy and fit. it is very important to work out and keep one's body fit to live longer. Further more, the introduction of junk food has ruined the diet of people today. People today are so fond of burgers, pizzas amd maggi, that it has become their staple food. they get obese and unhealthy and unwanted diseases are called for, which in turn curtails a person's life. Thus, in general, people are living shorter now."
p68
aS'as we all know that this is technological world .there are many technologies in everyu field.i.e.in medical field also.medical science ara using many technologies and saving peoples lives.before some time if someone is sufferying from any desease then there is no any medical facilty or money to save life.but now there are hospitals in every city and government is also helping peoples if there is major deseses.there are many facilities now.'

THINKING: In olden days someone told thinking is the first choice to LIVE HAPPILY FOR LONG TIME OR TO DIE IN SHORT TIME. Based on our thinking, our life will be planned. If we think negative, negative think will happen for us. If we think positive, positivity makes the life happier. 6. LIFE IS SHORT: For humans, life is only once. So we have to enjoy each and every second of our life. Whatever happens in life either it is positive or negative, we have to accept it and enjoy it. With a positive attitude we have to plan our life. TO LIVE LONGER: *Don't do negative thing for others. *Think positive and be positive. THANK YOU!!!!!"

aS"Modern medicine, knowledge on new healthier lifestyles, and other environmental influences allow an increasing number of people around the world to live longer. Though this phenomenon is true, as life expectancy increases, diseases and other conditions remain a critical threat and concern to the health of older people such as osteoporosis, Alzheimer's disease, cancer, cardiovascular diseases and others. The ability to reduce such burden among older adults will depend on the person's lifestyle and biological factors."

They are very meticulous about what they are eating. They eat healthy foods like organic vegetables and fruits because they have a place where they can plant their crops and trees. Urban areas help more people to live longer because of fresh air, unlike here in Manila wherein there's a pollution and an over populated place.

aS'Life expectancy is a statistical average of the number of years a human lives, assuming mortality conditions during a given time period; this will vary according to region and era. In the Bronze and Iron Age life expectancy was 26; the 2010 world average was 67.2. In Swaziland the average is 49.42 years; in Japan it is 82.6 years. The combination of high infant mortality and deaths in young adulthood from accidents, epidemics, plagues, wars, and childbirth, particularly before modern medicine was widely available, significantly lowers the overall life expectancy. But for those who survive early hazards, a life expectancy of sixty or seventy would not be uncommon. For example, a society with a life expectancy of 40 may have few people dying at age 40: most will die before 30 years of age or after 55. In countries with high infant mortality rates, life expectancy at birth is highly sensitive to the rate of death in the first few years of life. Because of this sensitivity to infant mortality, simple life expectancy at age zero can be subjected to gross misinterpretation, leading one to believe that a population with a low overall life expectancy will necessarily have a small proportion of older people. For example, in a hypothetical stationary population in which half the population dies before the age of five, but everybody else dies at exactly 70 years old, the life expectancy at age zero will be about 36 years, while about 25% of the population will be between the ages of 50 and 70. Another measure, such as life expectancy at age 5, can be used to exclude the effect of infant mortality to provide a simple measure of overall mortality rates other than in early childhood - in the hypothetical population above, life expectancy at age 5 would be another 65 years. Aggregate population measures, such as the proportion of the population in various age groups, should also be used alongside individual-based measures like formal life expectancy when analyzing population structure and dynamics.'

aS'These days people living more because of their food habits that may include good dietary balance, appropiate meal in specific interval time. Also reason they living more include that adequate rest to body after heavy work out helps to refresh the energy again.

aS'With the recent advancements in medical sciences and technology, one cannot agree more about the increment in the life span of human beings. Various causes, explanations and theories have been widely discussed in this context. Firstly, hospitals and health care centers spread across the globe have had a huge impact on the life span of people. With health advice and medicines accessible for all and that too within one or two mile radius from their localities, people have understood the age old wisdom of "prevention is better than cure". Also, with high levels of technological advancements and higher amounts of research to eliminate deadly bacteria and virus, one can safely assume the life span of an average human being will increase two-fold. Thirdly, the point to be noted is the present day awareness surrounding the world population. hundred years back, people wouldn\'t have had an ounce of knowledge about a common cold or an influenze symptom. Today, even a five year old kid can name the virus responsible AIDS. Understanding the causes of development is complex and very discreet at the same time. Vaccines were developed understanding the effect of the bacteria on animals. As rightly said by many, "necessity is the mother of all inventions". With the necessity to eliminate and eradicate deadly diseases, scientists all around the world have worked and are continuously working to make the world a better and healthy place to live in. In this process, immunization to various bacteria has helped man indirectly to live a long and also a health life. Also, Education can be cited as an important cause of this phenomenon. Education has imbibed people with the required amount of awareness about symptoms of various diseases and this has eventually lead to people preferrring a "precaution over cure" lifestyle.'

aS'The country has progressed in many ways like economically,socially,politically,technologically etc.So there is a change in lifestyle of the people also.As there is more facilities provided with the health consciousness.Nowadays peoploe have become more health conscious which is a good step for a healthy country.The medicinal systems are being divided as AYUSH i.s ayurveda,yoga,unani,siddha and homeopathy. There is wide range of demand for ayurvedic medicines rather than allopathy.Many prefer these because it prevents from attacking disease and it is slow as well as curing process.People have more medical facilities in allopathy also by importing medical instruments etc. People have a healthy diet routine followed by going to gyms,avoiding unhealthy food etc.This awareness is being brought because country like India has more health issues such as diabetics,BP,heart problems,neuro problems.To avoid all these health conscious is must. During vedic period and ancient times India had many medicines to cure .So they followed healthy diet,fresh food,fruits etc.Even our weather,nature also seems to have care on us like each season the fruits,flowers etc which are grown support Humans.Ex:In summer watermelons are famous becaouse they maintain the body temperature.The life expectancy rate is more in India as we are taking necessary steps control diseases such as vaccinations are provided for jaundice,typhoid. But still the country lacks in health issues because we do not have much medicinal benefits or diagnose the diseases.It is also stated that ayurveda,unani,siddha,yoga etc originated from India but he main problem is documentation of these medicines are low.So we should look forward for the healthy India and make the life expectancy rate more by research and development,creating more awareness to the health .'

p109
aS"We have heard that people of ancient ages lived longer. The reason is that they tried to live by nature, solely depending upon nature. We know the we cannot live without nature. Let us find the some of the reason why they were able to live longer,healthy and hygienically. I firmly believe that there is a creator of nature who has organized it perfectly to help humankind live healthier. So much of scientific inventions has deviated man away from nature. The food habits, the living style, dresses we wear. All of these has affected our health which reduces our lifetime. Our Body is like a machine that is designed to be systematic. God has created us like that by nature, It is very well organized. I am not a science student, but I can explain some of the basic things. Initially our digestive system is wondrous mechanism that is supernaturally created by God. As soon as we eat, when we intake food, it is ready to process the digestion. This is not by our order, it is done automatically, I believe it is the control of God. But as the science evolution started, we started developing varieties of colorful and delicious food, Our digestive system is loaded very much and that is the reason there is so much of diseases like Diabetes, obesity etc. The natural foods are harmless, the fruits, vegetables. They don't ruin our health. But these modern spicy Pizzas, burgers and so much. These are that that spoiled our body and reduced our lifetime. MAJOR REASONS ON FOOD THAT AFFECTS OUR LIFE PERIOD : * jun * contaminated foods. *Artificial attractions and colors that affects our body. We can live longer only if we only intake that is natural which has so much minerals without any side effects in future. I would rather live in a forest to eat fruits, vegetables which are moderate tasty and live longer than to devour modern foods that are spicy and delicious and die soon."
p110
aS'in general people are living longer in old life ,because of the only reason is that the people are very secure about her health .people are enjoy her life with our success and failure.but now a days we can say thhat this phenomenon is not true,because of the pollution and other some effect like unemployment.beacuse of this reason,now a days people are not leaving longer.A farmer use many fertilizer in the field,this fertilizer is also produces a disease,this reason,now a days people are not living longer.'

aS'Population is major problem of our country.India is a densely populated country and now-a-days people live longer.To maintain the population growth rate and death rate should be in a proper ratio.The main reason for this problem is the new medical faclities availble and the advanced medical treatments.Many fatal diseaeses like cancer have found cure.People now-a-days are more secured due to the new technologies.Risk in life has been reduced.Most of the people are getting their basic needs properly which is esssential to live a proper and longer life.Death rate has been decreased because now people are aware of all deadly diseases.Now everyone follows the moto "PREVENTION IS BETTER THAN CURE".People now-a-days are afraid of death and they do every possible thing to keep themself alive.People are greedy for their life. Medical facilities are advanced now that they can cure the heart diseases and pacemaker is available.Antidot for evry snake bite is available.Hospitals are availble immediately.Ambulance reaches the ruarl areas with less time.People are getting homely treatments so that a paralized person is able to live a life.The number of Doctors is increasing yearly. This has become a major problem because as the death rate has decreased density of people is increasing day by day.This has caused a severe effect on society.All natural resources are getting exhausted.Environment is harshly affected.Animal life is decreasing.Earthquakes are arising.Pollution Has been a major issue.No rains and droughts are spreading.Deforetration is increasing day by day.Scarcity of water is arising.Due to this after some period of time death rate will suddenly increase and barren lands will be left.Thus we should not neglect this issue as this issue can destroy the life on the Earth.To save our life and keep life on earth we Should reduce the birth rate and stop the population Explosion on Earth.We should follow the moto "HUM DO HUMARA EK "'

aS'I think one of the causes is modern technology. Technology is very advanced nowadays, and also technology comes into many forms. Gadgets and appliances are one of them. But also technology can be applied into medicines. In terms of having cancer it is treatable now by chemotherapy. In Dengue there are many tests that will idenify if you are positive or not. There are many of technologies seen on the hospitals now. Incubator, Dextrose, Pulserate reader, and many more. Many of the taken medicines uses technology. On TV Ads you can see brands of medicines. Because of technology our lives is easier now.'

aS'Improved access to healthcare has risen the number of years we live The advancements in technology in the fiel of medicine has not just benefited the rich and the affluent, but it also has trickled down to developing nations. One of the reasons this has happened is because of the availability of generic medicines. Indian pharmaceutical companies have played a major role in improving the access to medicines by manufacturing life saving drugs such as ARTs for HIV patients and cancer drugs at a fraction of the cost of the same drugs manufactured in the West. Even global health institutions such as the World Health Organisation (WHO) distributes generic good quality medicines in developing nations such as African countries, India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh which have been plagued by AIDS, multi-drug resistent TB and other chronic illnesses. Better access to medicines has helped raise life expectancy. In addition to improved access, the WHO is working with governments throughout the world to develop health programmes with an aim to make healthcare facilities available to the poor. They work in tandem with local non-profits, NGOs, village and local governments to implement national health policies and encourage a positive and scientific attitude towards health. This has had a positive impact on the health of people in various age groups and has resulted in reducing child mortality rates, therefore extending the number of years people live. Also, national health programmes such as Obamacare in the United States, the universal healthcare programme in United Kingdom and a more indigenous example and the DOTS tuberculosis control programme have helped improved access to healthcare by providing cheap and free healthcare facilities to every member of the society, regardless of his or her income. This, in turn, has helped people live longer, healthier lives.'

aS"It is indeed an encouraging fact that the average longevity, which is directly related to better health of individuals across the globe has strikingly increased over the years. Major contributiors to this are the steps actively taken by governments to reduce infant mortality and pregnancy mortality rates of women, which were leading to death during pregnancy. Several other factors have also contributed to the increased longevity of individuals like better health facilities available to the people, in general at affordable rates, inreased service rates of ambulances leading to lower casualties overall, an almost elimination of some diseases like tuberculosis etc. Also, social media has played a humongous role in informing people about the daily exercises and routines they need to adopt in order to lead a healthy life. Various forums on internet are used to share such information. Also, the rise of health maintenance practices suh as 'Yoga' have served as a major cause among the masees by making them actively engage in taking good care of their own selves. Various other campaigns for breast cancer, uteral cancer etc. have enabled women to be informed about such diseases and has helped several women to diagnose such diseases in early stages. Companies today also employ annual health check-up policies which help the employees take good care of their own. One intangible aspect that has resulted intoincreased longevity is the rise in income levels of people, in general. Not only has medical assistance become more affordable, it has also led to better retirement planning by individuals which has enabled them to live satisfactorily even post retirement, with sufficient amount of funds to sustain and lead a healthy life. Thus, steps actively taken by the governments along with rising awareness regarding health and diseases by various media has helped people lead healthy lives."

aS"It's true that in developed and developing countries, the people with well-off power status are living longer. But it's equally true that there are still cases of regions in the world where exploitation of masses by a few people closer to the strong holds of power is continuing. And in such nations, people are not having the increased life span this question is talking about. These are mostly the countries where there is dictatorship. Coming back to those egions where the life expectancy has actually risen in the past decaded, it seems to be a result of several causes. One of them is advancements in medical science. This advancement in medical science has further been facilitated by easy flow of information and knowledge accross the globe through advancements in information and communication technology. This has allowed to bring ideas and practices from even far off locations to learn from each other and advance. Another cause can be better knowledge management skills developed by the scholars of this era. This lets the world leaders realize the importance of structuring their action plans in a way that millitary battles have substantially reduced. For how long, this remains to be seen though. Hopefully for a long time. And all this depends on ability of our world leader to recognize world patterns and proactively act in a way so as to be able to successfully avoid conflicts. This replacement of milltary competetion with economic one has led to less war casualities. This has further been facilitated by nuclear deterents now being possesed by almost all major international powers. At the same time, this economic battle in some cases leads to the exploitation of pwerless masses in countries without democracy, which in turn leads to lesser life expectancy. A paradox apparently! Another reason for longer life expectancy can be - the increased ease of learning new skills. This has been made possible by better connectivity through internet, and efficient transport channels available. Research has proven that the longest living masses were those who were able to gather enough will to learn more and more, who never stopped learning, in every form- actions, reflection of actions, exploration for better options for actions, etc."

aS'I disagree to the fact that people live longer now. Unlikely in the earlier days, we get to see men and women live less longer in modern world. Earlier, the life expectancy ranged to 70-80 years but now it has come down to less than 50 years. The amount of diseases and iniquities has go up the ozone level that each day we see people die of cancer, tumor, cardiac arrests and so on. it was just yesterday i was been told to pray for one uncle of mine who was affected with a disease which the hospital officials could not even diagonise the fatal disease. The list does not end there. It goes on and on. The causes due to such early dismissal in life is mainly because of the food intake by the people. The amount of junk food, instant feeding systems, burgers with extra cheese and fries contributes to the above. We see even village dhabas have upgraded to another level but the food which they provide is not much of hygiene and declined sanitary working conditions. also pollution in terms of air, water, soil has gone up to another level where people inhale polluted air and water leading them to chronic water infections, respiratory ailments etc. Also, the people consuming the amount of smoke and alcohol has increased over the years. this leads to major lung disease, cardiac arrest, kidney failures and the list can be expanded. i do not see that people live longer now than the olden times. But the fact that lots of new medicines and curies is being developed every day. Lots of medical experiments as well trial outs make people live longer. Cancer centers and home care treatment which give special care to the patients make it cancer a much curable disease now. Thanks to technology and the brilliant minds of the doctors and researchers all over the world. Initiatives and measures can be taken to prevent the intake of beer. Awareness programs, restrictive use of alcohol can be framed and implemented successfully. I and you can be contribute a lot in making the world a better place to live .

aS'"People are living longer now" is pretty much a true statement and the reason behind this is the advancement in the field of Medical Science. The world has developed at a good pace with development of technologies and researches in various field of science. The contribution made in the field of medical science in the techonological aspect is comendable. The chance of survival from a severe disease has drastically increased as of researchers can experimentally test the success rate of cure for any disease using the tech aspects designed for the same. Few examples are: the Laser treatment for skin, kidney stones etc., MRI scans for fast detection of internal damage etc. Even in the field of Medical drugs production, the discovery of new elements and the stabilty of many compounds to produce effective medicines can now be well tested using experimental environment. The Medical Science has now got more medicinal cure which is safe and easy to go through rather than going through the tedious, expensive and painful operations. Such medicainal cure are affordable and any class of people can afford it. Apart from these aspects the Government has also taken many initiative to erradicate diseases which can be avoided at a much previous stage by spreading awareness and organising health camps. Hence the newly borns can be made safe from such diseases. WHO(World Health Organisation) is the major body that looks into this matter. It creates statistical report every year to rate the countries in terms of health and death rate. It also enforces countries under its guidance to take necessary step to avoid any major mishap. No medical way of keeping onself fit is also encouraged by WHO. By the awareness drives,yoga and exercise Ona whole the people are much safer now in comparison to the earlier time when such medical advancements were not present. The chances of living a fresh and healthy life are much greater now. Fitness is'

aS'With the fast paced growth of technology in the recent years, there has been a hand in hand increase in innovations. These new discoveries or innovations have taken place in many industries, of which the health and pharmaceutical industries has seen a high level of growth. With this fast paced growth and innovation, the world has seen the discoveriy of new drugs and medical discoveries to cure the many diseaseas that had once redered us helpless in the past. There has also been an increased interest in health and wellness programs in the recent years. Individuals of all ages have begun to place increased importance in their personal health and wellness. A rise in awareness and interest has been seen in the recent years, in health and wellness programs such as yoga, ayurveda, accupuncture and various meditation programs, as seen in the recent celebration of world yoga day. Organisations also promote health and wellness through provisions of various benefits and workshops such as medical allowance, insurance, etc. Organisations have also been seen to recognise the importance of mental health in the recent years.They have begun to introduce counsellors, trained coaches, employee assistance programs, etc to help assist their employees needs in a holistic manner. Through these various programs hosted and other benefits offered to individuals by various insititutions to promote health and wellness right from the educational level and continues even after retirement. Gone are the days when employees were used for their services and rewarded only with monetary benefits. Hence people are seen to live longer now since, more focus has been given to them as humans rather than machines. The human aspect is being given more importance and organisations are using this human aspect as an essential resource tied to their success.'

Fresh environment changes the mind of people & also helps to relieve stress. -Diet of people also matters in this case. a good Diet maintained can help a person to live a healthy life for more years. -Daily exercising also helps to relieve tension & hence leads a good & longer life.'

aS'i think that people are living longer now is mainly because of the modern things we have right now. As we know before there were no modern equipment so peoplr tend to work things manually. To give example to this is like farming before people can only do farming manually, Thus making people prone to accidents, But now we have modern equipment to aid our farmers. With modern equipment farmer are able to much work with less effort. Also before certain disease were not curable. But now due to modern medicine. we have discovered new medicine to battle those unknown disease. so that why i think people are living longer now than before.'

Nowadays, technology took a tremondous leap from the previous couple of decades and it made the great development in the various areas like medical, enggineering, industrial etc. As the medical innovations took place, we have cured lots of diseases that couldn't be cured previous days like cancers, polio, rabis, small pox etc where people died alot. This medical innovations made the people to cure near death deaseases also. People stated to think in the environmental way where their health as well as the environmental health teaks great turn. They started participating actively in the health awareness programs and in certains activities like gym, yoga, excercise and physical development therapies for physical wellness. For mental wellness they started doing meditation, laughing therapies etc. This is at one end On the other half technology made them to live shorter too. Technology made people to think big live big and act big. In this very sense they started trying vehicles which increased traffic, music beyond limits which made noise pollution, and foremore due to the lack of family relationships, value towards humans decreased which made people to lose humanity and stated encouraging terrorism like mass killing activities. These make the killing more even though people had chance to live longer these case make them live short and sadly unexpected deaths. People are living longer, but they can live more longer if they can take control on the environment, human relationships, technology, personal health ehich will make one to survive peacefully both inner as well as outer.

aS'REASONS FOR INCREASE IN LIFE EXPECTANCY: INTRODUCTION: It can be very well inferred from the census that the average life expectancy of people has drastically increased. It has become common to see people with age more than 80 years. Lets discuss some of the major reasons for this improvement. GOOD MEDICAL FACILITIES: The field of medical science has shown a major revolution. Nowadays there are medicines for almost all the diseases. For the diseases that cannot be cured using medicines, there are several surgical methods. Medical Engineering helps in the manufacture of precise surgical equipments. In some surgeries, robots that make use of artificial intelligence has proved to work successfully with greater accuracy in operation than human surgeons. OTHER REASONS: Apart from good medical facilities, there are few other reasons that play a major role in improving the life expectancy of human beings. (i) Food: Earlier days people used to eat food directly from the sources like plants or animals. Nowadays food is processed before consumption. Milk is pasteurized to remove bacteria. Sugar and salt are purified to get clear crystals. Likewise all the food items and water are properly purified to make it free of micro organisms like virus or bacteria. (ii) Neat and clean environment: The environment that we live in is sanitized well by the government. The government also takes efforts to reduce the mosquitoes by spraying chemicals and closing the drainages. Mosquitoes are parasites that are mainly responsible for several diseases like Malaria, Dengue, Cholera, Typhoid, some of which are deadly. CONCLUSION: Thus it can be inferred that the life expectancy of people could be increased day by day with development in technology and cooperation of people in making the environment a cleaner and safer place to live in.'

They also improving their diets, taking advices from the doctors about what to eat, when to eat, how to eat. Most of the companies are making herbals for making human body stronger. Many youngsters are taking their fitness seriously. They are going to the gyms, taking instructions from the body trainer and using various supplements for improving body. They daily uses the protein shakes with milk, egg,etc which is a good source of energy for our body.'

aS'I believe that people are living longer now because of the awareness brought by technology. There are four reasons why people are living longer now. First, they are well educated about the side effects of using products with harmful chemicals Second, they are now informed of what might happen if they will continue to patronized processed foods such as products with preservatives Third, there are products available in the market that are natural and organic, although these products are more expensive. Finally, people become more health conscious and give more time to read the contents of the products that they are using. Thus, people are living longer now.'

Quality of food intake has been better, various standards related to health and food has been introduced. People are more inclined for healthy diet and lifestyle. If this is continued at the same pace time may come when people will live till eternity.'

aS'Now a days, people life span increased. The average life span of the people was 80 plus. The following are the reason for the long life span, 1) Advance medical inventions 2) People knows well about the need of medication ( In olden days, people avoid to goto hospital, due to that the death rate increased, particularly in case of pregnancy) 3) Hygenic habits developed more.'

aS'"People are living longer now....." now a days we can say that more number of people are living longer in 21th centurie, than in an aceient time the reason behind that is the food required for the proper growth of their body as well as their maintality are provided properly which is not available in previous time period.when an women are pregnent they have all the facilities which are necessary to the growth of her child and also have the guidence of experties or we can say that the proper guidence of doctors.their monthly checkups,medicines and other care from her family which is not properly available in previous time no expert advice,no medicines and other care she can dose lots of work while she is pregnent becouse of this her child does not get proper health and he/she is suffer from many decises such as asthama and so on. when the child are growup their deices are also gets more harmful to her/his health thats why they does not live longer. In 21 th centurie their is expert advice many more new technologies to identify the deciese and have a solution over the ant decieses such as asthama and tumer.beyond this the people are very health concious they maintain their daily routine of their excercise and precousions they are got from their experts also they daily go to the joging,they drink fruit juice than to take more cup of coffe or tea.youth are joining the gyems to maintain their and body.peoples takes the precousions while they are travalling and eating food otside the homes.many machnaries and technologies are introduce to identify the deciese which is unknown to that perticular person they can check their health to identify their health is well proper or not because of all facilities are provided,expert advice and many more thing "people are living longer..............!" and this is benificial to the world to introduce new things.'

aS'Time is constantly changing and we are moving towards a more advanced and developed environment. We have solutions to every problem and we are able to overcome our problems within minutes and sometimes, we are able to obtain expert solutions to our problems with ease. This development over time is the main reason for the changes we incur now in comparison to the olden days. The main reasons for this development is the awareness which has built up among the people, the desire to grow, technology and digitalisation, acceptance to fast changing environment, need for faster and competent solutions. In olden days, while there was absolutely no technology or awarness, people inculcated natural means of curing diseases and finding solutions to their problems. These solutions by our ancestors are even now in use and are the best solutions too. The drawback these natural solutions had is that they were not swift in their approach and did not have the right specific impact. Improper medical facilities, no communication, no clear awareness about sexual health, unwillingness to adopt themselves to better facilities, no proper knowledge, all these led to smaller life spans of people despite the fact of having healthier lifestyles than the current generation. The current generation has got everything in their fingertips. Technology has blanketed every portion - healthcare, communication, lifestyle, education, etc. People present in all niches are made aware of the different diseases and problems that are prevailing and the solutions are also right before them through the most easily accessible manner. Solutions are there for even the deadliest of them can be cured with the proper guidance and the latest tools. Our entire lives are digitalised, and these remain the solution too for the ill effects occuring because of them. We control our life spans too!'

aS'"In general,people are living longer now." The simple reason behind this fact or phenomena is that now-a-days people are more concerned about their health and diet.They are even too cautious about their lives and the development in the science and technology had lead to the inventions of various treatments in the fields of medical science,which is just like a boon for people suffering from several diseases and gets recovered by these mazical treatments.This advancement in the medical science has been like a god\'s miracle,which can give the life to the patients once again.Besides,there are several people doing various exercises and joined various gyms ,in order to maintain good health.As people are very concious about their health, many yoga camps has been organized.The most surprising and great thing for our nation is that our prime minister Mr. Narendra Modi has promoted and organized for the "World Yoga Diwas" for the first time in the history,this really shows how much we all are concerned about our lives and health.I have also seen the craze of the body fitness and health improvement plans among youngsters.There are several number of people who control over their diet and eat only healthy things in order to make sure ,that whatever they eat should not harm to their health and this is what the leading phenomena towards the cause of people living longer these days.In ancient times ,people do not had any advanced science and technology in medical science and people were not so concious about their health and diets, they were just like used to eat whatever they wished, they never concern about the adverse effect of those in their health and there were not much number of hospitals for them to get treated for their health issues, and this fact had lead to their short lives,but now as there is advancement in everything,thus people are living longer now a days.'

aS'Life,as we say,is more of a process than what it really means.As we are heading to more progressive and advanced generations,we are facing problems as well as fortunes in life.Very Similarly,our Life too,has become a bit lengthy in contrast.People have started a bit longer as we can say it.Earlier,People used to live too longer but then with increasing ages,life became shorter than one could imagine and the reason was unknown to anyone.But,gradually,the reasons became known and people became that intelligent too,to find out the solutions to those problems which could hamper our people.For example,once people used to die of diseases unaware of their knowledge about diseases,but now,our doctors have found out their ways to eradicate those diseases.Diseases are common nowadays bt we have found out how to deal with them.What could be more achievable than this?Even the most deadly and dreadful diseases have been shown their way out from this world.Nowadays,when people get a little problem,they head towards a doctor.Its not that only our doctors have earned this achievement,but we,our people too,have earned this,through our constant efforts.Efforts like,everybody has become conscious for own self as well as for others.People are way more interested in educating their children as well as others for the betterment of us.This is definitely an achievement for them as well as for us.Our ancestors used to say,In order to live longer,We need a Healthy mind as well as a Healthy Body.They would have been happier to see what fruits are have come to their planted trees,their younger generations.A healthy body refers to eating healthy,staying out of bad food habits and staying far from diseases too.And,a Heathy mind refers to bringing good thoughts into our mind.Because science says too,whatever we think happens to us.Thus,People are living longer now.We can just say,Think good,do good,be good and live long.'

aS"These days nothing is impossible, all thanks to our technology and science which has made everything a small phenomenon.Living till the age of 90-95 is not a big deal or probably i should say if a person is alive till the age of 100 years also their is nothing suprising. But keeping in mind the kind of health facilities we have in india , it is a big problem indeed. we have huge number of patients but less beds and facilities in our government hospitals and affording a private hospital fees is no more a matter of joke. In old age a person IS faced with alot of health issues , thereby adding more financial burden to one's family as well as the society. government has increased the expenditure on health and development but india's popullation is huge. it is obvious we love our family memebers and it is difficult to see them going away from us in old age also. but if that person is occupying a bed in a goverment hospital that is not even morally correct may be beacuse of that someone could have led a better and healthy life. Moreover, nowadays youth dont want to live in a joint family. they send their parents in old age home and this is not even ethically correct.they should know what is their responsibilty towards their family and society at large. By saying all these i dont mean that in old age people should die but keeping the social and economic condition of our country in mind it is somehow posing a problem there are various reasons for such extended life span: 1. better standard of living 2. great medical facilties at doorsteps 3. people are more health conscious. everyone love their family so they try their level best taht they stay with them lifelong.they provide healthy environment to them , these days people go to gym or do yoga in such a small age. theyu want to keep themselves FIT AS FIDDLE.

aS'nowadays people are getting more stronger and younger as well compared with there healthg and their surrounding they are preferebly liking to be at peace and nice time which makes them healthier and stronger as well.basically a person should be confident about themselves and not really scared about their health unnecessarily which makes people more depressed and not to enjoy their life thimking about it.then we also have much more helath organisation places to very well look after the old people and many medical health care are also been started giving treatment in any critical situation like for example people nowadays jus feel "cancer" like some normal nfever or something jus because they are totally ready to spend money on any basis specifically for anyones health .people are mor likely to live longer nowadays by enjoying with there grand children which makes them forget oneself and live there own life .but as in the major thing is thge medical invents newly as been brought into the process were it is like if a person is ready to pay howmuch ever the bill is the helath is been cured and the person is saved. that is the major idea of the hospitals nowadays which automatically make the normal people to make live longer and much more sometimes.we have frequent treatments been given to the person who is not well and makes his or her life cycle extend.this also says that not only the medical organisation make people stronger or something but also ones own life being happier anf finding peace within themselves without getting into any crap which eventually makes people peacefully live their life and needed care sometimes.for example if we take "cancer" doctors says that the person has like 6 months time and then he dies as in giving hor her expiry date but nowadays they have this chance to actually extend ones life from 6 months or 1 year to some 2 years by taking continuos therapy needed for the treatment.'

aS'The scientific and technological advancement has influenced the life span of people. According to the recent surveys, people, nowadays are living longer than earlier. At earlier times, medical science and medicines were not sufficient to cure diseases and people demised due to extreme sufferings and pain. But in 21st century, the entire scenario is completely different. Medical science has come up with solutions to cure deadly diseases like small pox, plague, cholera, cancer, Tuberculosis and the list is endless. A huge credit goes to \'Biotechnology\', the branch of science which deals with biological technology and advancement. Engineerings from bio-medical fields have come up with new instruments and technology which made detecting cancer easier. It is the pride of science, that nowadays, a deadly disease like cancer is curable. Apart from technological advancement, social life and environment also play equal role to enhance Human life span. Compared to old times, when people were not aware of proper cleanliness, diseases and infections were common but nowadays, people take special care of cleanliness and hygienes. Roads and drains are cleaned in every due time. Special departments are being made in every area who take care of cleanliness and hygienes.Hence the common infections and diseases which demised people earlier are now no more a matter of concern. Individuals themselves have become aware of their health. On addition, Indian Government has itself taken initiatives named "Swaach Bharat Abhiyan" which is helping India to become cleaner and better place to live in. However, technology and cleanliness are not the only reasons which have enhanced people\'s life span. A very important point to be noted in this context, is the rising popularity of yoga and fitness which has successfully increased the life span of an indivisual.'
p201
aS"When you observe in an overall basis , people live longer now not because there are no problems or diseases but because the technology has increased this much that every problem has its solution. Firstly , if we bring into our notice during olden days people were hardly concerned about their life , they just wanted to live for the sake of living because that time the generation was different , they had no aim and no reasons to live . But when we look on the overall basis today everyone has their opinion, their way of living and no one wants to just die rather achieve something and live longer. it was always said that good health always leads you to a good path. before it was difficult for the prople to undersatand but now even from a child till the old people , everyone has realised the importance of good health and the purpose living No one can predict that for how many years someone's going to live but a person can surely increase his life span by having a good health, maintaing his pysique , and having a happy life . resons of living longer is just a simple thing be happy always , reduce stress and for reducing stress best solution is doing excercise regularly ( yoga ) . since people are living longer automatically they get into the fact that yes they have to do something in their life. today their is no age limit for anything. old people who couldnt study in their age are completing their degrees in various forms. and they realise that how much is life important to them. its all about human tendency to begin and proceed in their life in which way. The other reason which can be is reduction in intake of tabacco and alchol . though people intake it but they know their limits and in addition todays technology is reaching the hieghts there is no problem which cannot be cured. The causes of this phenomenon is that as people are living longer the values cultures beliefs etc is still existing in this world. because when you compare a joint family will be more discipline and decent compared to nuclear family .LIVING LONGER is just the matter of thinking. its all about how you live your life , in which way and when you die you know that you have achieved something in your life."

The people who are living longer now are very rare in case and they are very uncountable. we have many phenomenon in nature some of them are being discussed briefly, due to the food habbits they had from their young age is the one reason for their longer living, they played very well and had many healthy habbits especially ladies had many exercising activities like cooking, griding, washing their cloths by themselves theey also did their household activities by themselves withput appointing any of the women for the work. nowadays people are being doing their works by appointing someone and they are doing their works by using machinaries. This is being very much difficult to live longer. People are being afected by many diseases in thier younger age itself. This is a main phenomenon of nowadays. we have to survive under this and segragate from this habbits. We have to diet very healthy and do our daily workd by ourselves this is also a best solution to our longer live . There are certain peoples who have some of the heridity problems they have to be taken care properly and lead according to the doctors advisory. In this generation people like teenage are adicted to fast food like pizza, burger,oil fried items. These items, when we consume more will lead to many problems like obesity, hearthole, thyroid. we have to exercise for atleast an hour daily . This will be an good practise. Daily people should consume more food at morning, half of the meal at afternoon and very lesser food at night this avery good practise for a normal man. Daily drinking of green tea, eating of fresh fruits wiill also lead a longer life. These are the phenomenon on my point of view.'
