With health advice and medicines accessible for all and that too within one or two mile radius from their localities, people have understood the age old wisdom of \"prevention is better than cure\". Also, with high levels of technological advancements and higher amounts of research to eliminate deadly bacteria and virus, one can safely assume the life span of an average human being will increase two-fold.

Today, even a five year old kid can name the virus responsible AIDS. Understanding the causes of development is complex and very discreet at the same time.

Indian pharmaceutical companies have played a major role in improving the access to medicines by manufacturing life saving drugs such as ARTs for HIV patients and cancer drugs at a fraction of the cost of the same drugs manufactured in the West. Even global health institutions such as the World Health Organisation (WHO) distributes generic good quality medicines in developing nations such as African countries, India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh which have been plagued by AIDS, multi-drug resistent TB and other chronic illnesses. Better access to medicines has helped raise life expectancy. In addition to improved access, the WHO is working with governments throughout the world to develop health programmes with an aim to make healthcare facilities available to the poor. They work in tandem with local non-profits, NGOs, village and local governments to implement national health policies and encourage a positive and scientific attitude towards health. This has had a positive impact on the health of people in various age groups and has resulted in reducing child mortality rates, therefore extending the number of years people live.

GOOD MEDICAL FACILITIES: The field of medical science has shown a major revolution. Nowadays there are medicines for almost all the diseases. For the diseases that cannot be cured using medicines, there are several surgical methods. Medical Engineering helps in the manufacture of precise surgical equipments. In some surgeries, robots that make use of artificial intelligence has proved to work successfully with greater accuracy in operation than human surgeons. OTHER REASONS: Apart from good medical facilities, there are few other reasons that play a major role in improving the life expectancy of human beings. (i) Food: Earlier days people used to eat food directly from the sources like plants or animals. Nowadays food is processed before consumption. Milk is pasteurized to remove bacteria. Sugar and salt are purified to get clear crystals. Likewise all the food items and water are properly purified to make it free of micro organisms like virus or bacteria. (ii) Neat and clean environment: The environment that we live in is sanitized well by the government. The government also takes efforts to reduce the mosquitoes by spraying chemicals and closing the drainages. Mosquitoes are parasites that are mainly responsible for several diseases like Malaria, Dengue, Cholera, Typhoid, some of which are deadly.

Before and all the life span of a human was 100years and later it turned to 90 and then 80, this was made as 70 soon and hardly now the life span of a person is nearly 60 and there are only few who have a long life span.This decrease in level of life span is due to the adoptation of new culture and which also includes their food culture which is totally not suitable for our national. so due to these reasons, man started to face nameless diseases and this leads to sooner death. This kind of health problems were started to be cured by the invention of new medicines and also some times by imported medicines. Apart from everything,sugar,blood pressure,kidney stone and heart attack are the major problems faced by this generation humans. since, all the diseases doesn't have medicines to be cured but they can partialy increase the life span of the humans. obesity is not considered as a disease where many advanced equipments are available which will suck out the unwanted calories and fat out but this precess is also a very costly process. if a person had got any fire injuries means they can immediately undergo plastic surgeries which may bring back their own face are a new one.

The list does not end there. It goes on and on. The causes due to such early dismissal in life is mainly because of the food intake by the people. The amount of junk food, instant feeding systems, burgers with extra cheese and fries contributes to the above. We see even village dhabas have upgraded to another level but the food which they provide is not much of hygiene and declined sanitary working conditions. also pollution in terms of air, water, soil has gone up to another level where people inhale polluted air and water leading them to chronic water infections, respiratory ailments etc. Also, the people consuming the amount of smoke and alcohol has increased over the years. this leads to major lung disease, cardiac arrest, kidney failures and the list can be expanded. i do not see that people live longer now than the olden times. But the fact that lots of new medicines and curies is being developed every day. Lots of medical experiments as well trial outs make people live longer. Cancer centers and home care treatment which give special care to the patients make it cancer a much curable disease now.
