[{"text": "With the recent advancements in medical sciences and technology, one cannot agree more about the increment in the life span of human beings. Various causes, explanations and theories have been widely discussed in this context. Firstly, hospitals and health care centers spread across the globe have had a huge impact on the life span of people. With health advice and medicines accessible for all and that too within one or two mile radius from their localities, people have understood the age old wisdom of \"prevention is better than cure\". Also, with high levels of technological advancements and higher amounts of research to eliminate deadly bacteria and virus, one can safely assume the life span of an average human being will increase two-fold. Thirdly, the point to be noted is the present day awareness surrounding the world population. hundred years back, people wouldn't have had an ounce of knowledge about a common cold or an influenze symptom. Today, even a five year old kid can name the virus responsible AIDS. Understanding the causes of development is complex and very discreet at the same time. Vaccines were developed understanding the effect of the bacteria on animals. As rightly said by many, \"necessity is the mother of all inventions\". With the necessity to eliminate and eradicate deadly diseases, scientists all around the world have worked and are continuously working to make the world a better and healthy place to live in. In this process, immunization to various bacteria has helped man indirectly to live a long and also a health life. Also, Education can be cited as an important cause of this phenomenon. Education has imbibed people with the required amount of awareness about symptoms of various diseases and this has eventually lead to people preferrring a \"precaution over cure\" lifestyle.", "score": 4}, {"text": "People live longer because right now there are too many medicines to drink to healthy lifestyle drink which they will help you to become fit & stay strong.

Before and all the life span of a human was 100years and later it turned to 90 and then 80, this was made as 70 soon and hardly now the life span of a person is nearly 60 and there are only few who have a long life span.This decrease in level of life span is due to the adoptation of new culture and which also includes their food culture which is totally not suitable for our national. so due to these reasons, man started to face nameless diseases and this leads to sooner death. This kind of health problems were started to be cured by the invention of new medicines and also some times by imported medicines. Apart from everything,sugar,blood pressure,kidney stone and heart attack are the major problems faced by this generation humans. since, all the diseases doesn't have medicines to be cured but they can partialy increase the life span of the humans. obesity is not considered as a disease where many advanced equipments are available which will suck out the unwanted calories and fat out but this precess is also a very costly process. if a person had got any fire injuries means they can immediately undergo plastic surgeries which may bring back their own face are a new one.

The drawback these natural solutions had is that they were not swift in their approach and did not have the right specific impact.

One of the reasons this has happened is because of the availability of generic medicines. Indian pharmaceutical companies have played a major role in improving the access to medicines by manufacturing life saving drugs such as ARTs for HIV patients and cancer drugs at a fraction of the cost of the same drugs manufactured in the West. Even global health institutions such as the World Health Organisation (WHO) distributes generic good quality medicines in developing nations such as African countries, India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh which have been plagued by AIDS, multi-drug resistent TB and other chronic illnesses. Better access to medicines has helped raise life expectancy. In addition to improved access, the WHO is working with governments throughout the world to develop health programmes with an aim to make healthcare facilities available to the poor. They work in tandem with local non-profits, NGOs, village and local governments to implement national health policies and encourage a positive and scientific attitude towards health. This has had a positive impact on the health of people in various age groups and has resulted in reducing child mortality rates, therefore extending the number of years people live. Also, national health programmes such as Obamacare in the United States, the universal healthcare programme in United Kingdom and a more indigenous example and the DOTS tuberculosis control programme have helped improved access to healthcare by providing cheap and free healthcare facilities to every member of the society, regardless of his or her income.
