In the Bronze and Iron Age life expectancy was 26; the 2010 world average was 67.2. In Swaziland the average is 49.42 years; in Japan it is 82.6 years. The combination of high infant mortality and deaths in young adulthood from accidents, epidemics, plagues, wars, and childbirth, particularly before modern medicine was widely available, significantly lowers the overall life expectancy. But for those who survive early hazards, a life expectancy of sixty or seventy would not be uncommon. For example, a society with a life expectancy of 40 may have few people dying at age 40: most will die before 30 years of age or after 55. In countries with high infant mortality rates, life expectancy at birth is highly sensitive to the rate of death in the first few years of life. Because of this sensitivity to infant mortality, simple life expectancy at age zero can be subjected to gross misinterpretation, leading one to believe that a population with a low overall life expectancy will necessarily have a small proportion of older people. For example, in a hypothetical stationary population in which half the population dies before the age of five, but everybody else dies at exactly 70 years old, the life expectancy at age zero will be about 36 years, while about 25% of the population will be between the ages of 50 and 70. Another measure, such as life expectancy at age 5, can be used to exclude the effect of infant mortality to provide a simple measure of overall mortality rates other than in early childhood - in the hypothetical population above, life expectancy at age 5 would be another 65 years. Aggregate population measures, such as the proportion of the population in various age groups, should also be used alongside individual-based measures like formal life expectancy when analyzing population structure and dynamics.", "score": 1}, {"text": "yes,i agree this phenomenon.this time in general ,pepole are living longer time.Because bio-medical technology every day developed", "score": 1}, {"text": "Life,as we say,is more of a process than what it really means.As we are heading to more progressive and advanced generations,we are facing problems as well as fortunes in life.Very Similarly,our Life too,has become a bit lengthy in contrast.People have started a bit longer as we can say it.Earlier,People used to live too longer but then with increasing ages,life became shorter than one could imagine and the reason was unknown to anyone.But,gradually,the reasons became known and people became that intelligent too,to find out the solutions to those problems which could hamper our people.For example,once people used to die of diseases unaware of their knowledge about diseases,but now,our doctors have found out their ways to eradicate those diseases.Diseases are common nowadays bt we have found out how to deal with them.What could be more achievable than this?Even the most deadly and dreadful diseases have been shown their way out from this world.Nowadays,when people get a little problem,they head towards a doctor.Its not that only our doctors have earned this achievement,but we,our people too,have earned this,through our constant efforts.Efforts like,everybody has become conscious for own self as well as for others.People are way more interested in educating their children as well as others for the betterment of us.This is definitely an achievement for them as well as for us.Our ancestors used to say,In order to live longer,We need a Healthy mind as well as a Healthy Body.They would have been happier to see what fruits are have come to their planted trees,their younger generations.A healthy body refers to eating healthy,staying out of bad food habits and staying far from diseases too.And,a Heathy mind refers to bringing good thoughts into our mind.Because science says too,whatever we think happens to us.Thus,People are living longer now.We can just say,Think good,do good,be good and live long.", "score": 2}, {"text": "Today people are living longer.

Major contributiors to this are the steps actively taken by governments to reduce infant mortality and pregnancy mortality rates of women, which were leading to death during pregnancy. Several other factors have also contributed to the increased longevity of individuals like better health facilities available to the people, in general at affordable rates, inreased service rates of ambulances leading to lower casualties overall, an almost elimination of some diseases like tuberculosis etc. Also, social media has played a humongous role in informing people about the daily exercises and routines they need to adopt in order to lead a healthy life. Various forums on internet are used to share such information. Also, the rise of health maintenance practices suh as 'Yoga' have served as a major cause among the masees by making them actively engage in taking good care of their own selves. Various other campaigns for breast cancer, uteral cancer etc. have enabled women to be informed about such diseases and has helped several women to diagnose such diseases in early stages. Companies today also employ annual health check-up policies which help the employees take good care of their own. One intangible aspect that has resulted intoincreased longevity is the rise in income levels of people, in general. Not only has medical assistance become more affordable, it has also led to better retirement planning by individuals which has enabled them to live satisfactorily even post retirement, with sufficient amount of funds to sustain and lead a healthy life. Thus, steps actively taken by the governments along with rising awareness regarding health and diseases by various media has helped people lead healthy lives.", "score": 6}, {"text": "It's true that in developed and developing countries, the people with well-off power status are living longer.

And in such nations, people are not having the increased life span this question is talking about. These are mostly the countries where there is dictatorship. Coming back to those egions where the life expectancy has actually risen in the past decaded, it seems to be a result of several causes. One of them is advancements in medical science. This advancement in medical science has further been facilitated by easy flow of information and knowledge accross the globe through advancements in information and communication technology. This has allowed to bring ideas and practices from even far off locations to learn from each other and advance. Another cause can be better knowledge management skills developed by the scholars of this era. This lets the world leaders realize the importance of structuring their action plans in a way that millitary battles have substantially reduced. For how long, this remains to be seen though. Hopefully for a long time. And all this depends on ability of our world leader to recognize world patterns and proactively act in a way so as to be able to successfully avoid conflicts. This replacement of milltary competetion with economic one has led to less war casualities. This has further been facilitated by nuclear deterents now being possesed by almost all major international powers. At the same time, this economic battle in some cases leads to the exploitation of pwerless masses in countries without democracy, which in turn leads to lesser life expectancy. A paradox apparently! Another reason for longer life expectancy can be - the increased ease of learning new skills. This has been made possible by better connectivity through internet, and efficient transport channels available. Research has proven that the longest living masses were those who were able to gather enough will to learn more and more, who never stopped learning, in every form- actions, reflection of actions, exploration for better options for actions, etc.", "score": 6}, {"text": "People from the whole world are living longer now a day's just because of develope modern technology .
