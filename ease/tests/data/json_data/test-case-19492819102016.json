I would like to keep my stance as people lived longer before. the average age has been curtailed to 70 today. it is very disappointing that even with the advancement of technology and research in the field of pharmacy, health related issues and the disesases, people today don't live as long as before The lives have metamorphosed and every person is burdened with a lot of things. Education has taken a toll on student's life in today's world.a person judged on your degrees,marks, percentage, ranks. it defines how serious or committed a person is towards its work. Everyone around starts pestering a student and would expect him to study for hours. He no more can have an ecstatic carefree life, unlike our ancestors. Our ancestors would engage themselves by playing outdoor games like gilli danda, called cricket today, kabadi, sitolya and wouldn't be stuck in front of laptop working on their assignments or television watching sitcoms. the excessive competition has simply imbalanced a child's life and a person is put to stress from the very first stage of life. Reportedly, the number of suicides due to stress has increased dramatically. Stress is one of the major concerns today. it is one of the major reasons for living shorter today. one should strike a balance between education and co-curricular to stay healthy and fit. it is very important to work out and keep one's body fit to live longer. Further more, the introduction of junk food has ruined the diet of people today. People today are so fond of burgers, pizzas amd maggi, that it has become their staple food. they get obese and unhealthy and unwanted diseases are called for, which in turn curtails a person's life.

The reason is that they tried to live by nature, solely depending upon nature. We know the we cannot live without nature. Let us find the some of the reason why they were able to live longer,healthy and hygienically. I firmly believe that there is a creator of nature who has organized it perfectly to help humankind live healthier. So much of scientific inventions has deviated man away from nature. The food habits, the living style, dresses we wear. All of these has affected our health which reduces our lifetime. Our Body is like a machine that is designed to be systematic. God has created us like that by nature, It is very well organized. I am not a science student, but I can explain some of the basic things. Initially our digestive system is wondrous mechanism that is supernaturally created by God. As soon as we eat, when we intake food, it is ready to process the digestion. This is not by our order, it is done automatically, I believe it is the control of God. But as the science evolution started, we started developing varieties of colorful and delicious food, Our digestive system is loaded very much and that is the reason there is so much of diseases like Diabetes, obesity etc. The natural foods are harmless, the fruits, vegetables. They don't ruin our health. But these modern spicy Pizzas, burgers and so much. These are that that spoiled our body and reduced our lifetime. MAJOR REASONS ON FOOD THAT AFFECTS OUR LIFE PERIOD : * jun * contaminated foods. *Artificial attractions and colors that affects our body. We can live longer only if we only intake that is natural which has so much minerals without any side effects in future.

In the Bronze and Iron Age life expectancy was 26; the 2010 world average was 67.2. In Swaziland the average is 49.42 years; in Japan it is 82.6 years. The combination of high infant mortality and deaths in young adulthood from accidents, epidemics, plagues, wars, and childbirth, particularly before modern medicine was widely available, significantly lowers the overall life expectancy. But for those who survive early hazards, a life expectancy of sixty or seventy would not be uncommon. For example, a society with a life expectancy of 40 may have few people dying at age 40: most will die before 30 years of age or after 55. In countries with high infant mortality rates, life expectancy at birth is highly sensitive to the rate of death in the first few years of life. Because of this sensitivity to infant mortality, simple life expectancy at age zero can be subjected to gross misinterpretation, leading one to believe that a population with a low overall life expectancy will necessarily have a small proportion of older people. For example, in a hypothetical stationary population in which half the population dies before the age of five, but everybody else dies at exactly 70 years old, the life expectancy at age zero will be about 36 years, while about 25% of the population will be between the ages of 50 and 70. Another measure, such as life expectancy at age 5, can be used to exclude the effect of infant mortality to provide a simple measure of overall mortality rates other than in early childhood - in the hypothetical population above, life expectancy at age 5 would be another 65 years.

Various causes, explanations and theories have been widely discussed in this context. Firstly, hospitals and health care centers spread across the globe have had a huge impact on the life span of people. With health advice and medicines accessible for all and that too within one or two mile radius from their localities, people have understood the age old wisdom of \"prevention is better than cure\". Also, with high levels of technological advancements and higher amounts of research to eliminate deadly bacteria and virus, one can safely assume the life span of an average human being will increase two-fold. Thirdly, the point to be noted is the present day awareness surrounding the world population. hundred years back, people wouldn't have had an ounce of knowledge about a common cold or an influenze symptom. Today, even a five year old kid can name the virus responsible AIDS. Understanding the causes of development is complex and very discreet at the same time. Vaccines were developed understanding the effect of the bacteria on animals. As rightly said by many, \"necessity is the mother of all inventions\". With the necessity to eliminate and eradicate deadly diseases, scientists all around the world have worked and are continuously working to make the world a better and healthy place to live in. In this process, immunization to various bacteria has helped man indirectly to live a long and also a health life. Also, Education can be cited as an important cause of this phenomenon.

Several other factors have also contributed to the increased longevity of individuals like better health facilities available to the people, in general at affordable rates, inreased service rates of ambulances leading to lower casualties overall, an almost elimination of some diseases like tuberculosis etc. Also, social media has played a humongous role in informing people about the daily exercises and routines they need to adopt in order to lead a healthy life. Various forums on internet are used to share such information. Also, the rise of health maintenance practices suh as 'Yoga' have served as a major cause among the masees by making them actively engage in taking good care of their own selves. Various other campaigns for breast cancer, uteral cancer etc. have enabled women to be informed about such diseases and has helped several women to diagnose such diseases in early stages. Companies today also employ annual health check-up policies which help the employees take good care of their own. One intangible aspect that has resulted intoincreased longevity is the rise in income levels of people, in general. Not only has medical assistance become more affordable, it has also led to better retirement planning by individuals which has enabled them to live satisfactorily even post retirement, with sufficient amount of funds to sustain and lead a healthy life.
