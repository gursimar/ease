It has become common to see people with age more than 80 years. Lets discuss some of the major reasons for this improvement. GOOD MEDICAL FACILITIES: The field of medical science has shown a major revolution. Nowadays there are medicines for almost all the diseases. For the diseases that cannot be cured using medicines, there are several surgical methods. Medical Engineering helps in the manufacture of precise surgical equipments. In some surgeries, robots that make use of artificial intelligence has proved to work successfully with greater accuracy in operation than human surgeons. OTHER REASONS: Apart from good medical facilities, there are few other reasons that play a major role in improving the life expectancy of human beings. (i) Food: Earlier days people used to eat food directly from the sources like plants or animals. Nowadays food is processed before consumption. Milk is pasteurized to remove bacteria. Sugar and salt are purified to get clear crystals. Likewise all the food items and water are properly purified to make it free of micro organisms like virus or bacteria. (ii) Neat and clean environment: The environment that we live in is sanitized well by the government. The government also takes efforts to reduce the mosquitoes by spraying chemicals and closing the drainages. Mosquitoes are parasites that are mainly responsible for several diseases like Malaria, Dengue, Cholera, Typhoid, some of which are deadly. CONCLUSION: Thus it can be inferred that the life expectancy of people could be increased day by day with development in technology and cooperation of people in making the environment a cleaner and safer place to live in.", "score": 5}, {"text": "\"In general people are living longer now\" is a very true fact. Living longer has been made possible largely due to the advancement of technology, awareness among people, better infrastructure being provided by the governments , ease of accessibility to medi-care , increasing awareness and campaigns on health and hygiene. The reasons stated above are the broad reasons catering to increasing life span of people of all economies - developed , developing and also underdeveloped. The developed economies of the world are already advance and aware and are continuosly working for the betterment of the its citizens. Firstly , it has been made possible due to the large amount of funds available at the disposal of such developed economies. In collaboration with huge resources and efficient governance , the developed economies are continuosly investing in research programs. With the advancement in techonology and of medical science various vaccines have been produced which have been successfull in eradicating deadly dieases like small pox from all over the globe. Further , with the unrelenting efforts of the UN organisation - WHO these vaccines have been made available even to the remote areas so that the dieases can be successfully eradicated. Secondly , as compared to earlier times , people have become more aware about their well-being and so they too take initiative in maintaining their health. Thirdly , governments are now taking adequate steps to provide better sanitation facilities to the people which has helped in preventing people from contracting dieses like malaria , diarreohea , typhoid , fever etc. The Swatch Bharat Abhiyaan initiated by the Modi government is in furtherance of this cause. There are many other reasons which have led to increase in the life span of people and government's efforts in this cause can not be over shadowed.", "score": 5}, {"text": "According to me in general people are living longer now because of best treatment has provided by the doctors.many medicines are available to improve our health.in this era many diseases are treeted by the doctor for thae long life for the people.in this age cancer is also treatable.in the older days when the pepole had not treated by the doctor that may caused of the death.so i think that today is very easy to solve any trouble into the health that should be solved by the doctors.this is the era of science where nothing is impossible.everything is possible in this age.medical science research in many sides of the diseases. many of the people are fight for the diseases end improve the health.one of the best example of that is cricketr Youraj singh fight for the blood cancer and take a treatment into the abroad now he is good for health.so now a days people live long.

Education has taken a toll on student's life in today's world.a person judged on your degrees,marks, percentage, ranks. it defines how serious or committed a person is towards its work. Everyone around starts pestering a student and would expect him to study for hours. He no more can have an ecstatic carefree life, unlike our ancestors. Our ancestors would engage themselves by playing outdoor games like gilli danda, called cricket today, kabadi, sitolya and wouldn't be stuck in front of laptop working on their assignments or television watching sitcoms. the excessive competition has simply imbalanced a child's life and a person is put to stress from the very first stage of life. Reportedly, the number of suicides due to stress has increased dramatically. Stress is one of the major concerns today. it is one of the major reasons for living shorter today. one should strike a balance between education and co-curricular to stay healthy and fit. it is very important to work out and keep one's body fit to live longer. Further more, the introduction of junk food has ruined the diet of people today.

Development of any nation does not only depends on per capita income but actually on standard of living of its residents and this has formed the basis of development of HDI. An average increase in life expectancy years can be seen through records and there have been multiple changes in the society which support this increase. 1. Recent researches show that population below poverty line in India has been reduced to about 12% only which was more than 30% some decades ago. Spending power has increased and hence people utilise this increase in resources to maintain their well-being. 2. Globalisation has allowed MNC's to setup their offices across borders & as per international policies, companies also provide health cover to employees and their family members. This is also an important factor as formal systems have been established which make accessiblity to medical services easier. 3. Government has also taken commendable steps to improve the situation. Government Dispenceries have been opened on large scale which provide better health facilities to poor at affordable costs in just a few kilometers reach. 4. Government also provides health services to its employees as well. Large number of families across India get direct benefit from such policies which eventually increase in nhigher life expactancy. 5.

God has created us like that by nature, It is very well organized. I am not a science student, but I can explain some of the basic things. Initially our digestive system is wondrous mechanism that is supernaturally created by God. As soon as we eat, when we intake food, it is ready to process the digestion. This is not by our order, it is done automatically, I believe it is the control of God. But as the science evolution started, we started developing varieties of colorful and delicious food, Our digestive system is loaded very much and that is the reason there is so much of diseases like Diabetes, obesity etc. The natural foods are harmless, the fruits, vegetables. They don't ruin our health. But these modern spicy Pizzas, burgers and so much. These are that that spoiled our body and reduced our lifetime. MAJOR REASONS ON FOOD THAT AFFECTS OUR LIFE PERIOD : * jun * contaminated foods. *Artificial attractions and colors that affects our body.

And in such nations, people are not having the increased life span this question is talking about. These are mostly the countries where there is dictatorship. Coming back to those egions where the life expectancy has actually risen in the past decaded, it seems to be a result of several causes. One of them is advancements in medical science. This advancement in medical science has further been facilitated by easy flow of information and knowledge accross the globe through advancements in information and communication technology. This has allowed to bring ideas and practices from even far off locations to learn from each other and advance. Another cause can be better knowledge management skills developed by the scholars of this era. This lets the world leaders realize the importance of structuring their action plans in a way that millitary battles have substantially reduced. For how long, this remains to be seen though. Hopefully for a long time. And all this depends on ability of our world leader to recognize world patterns and proactively act in a way so as to be able to successfully avoid conflicts. This replacement of milltary competetion with economic one has led to less war casualities. This has further been facilitated by nuclear deterents now being possesed by almost all major international powers. At the same time, this economic battle in some cases leads to the exploitation of pwerless masses in countries without democracy, which in turn leads to lesser life expectancy. A paradox apparently! Another reason for longer life expectancy can be - the increased ease of learning new skills. This has been made possible by better connectivity through internet, and efficient transport channels available.

In the Bronze and Iron Age life expectancy was 26; the 2010 world average was 67.2. In Swaziland the average is 49.42 years; in Japan it is 82.6 years. The combination of high infant mortality and deaths in young adulthood from accidents, epidemics, plagues, wars, and childbirth, particularly before modern medicine was widely available, significantly lowers the overall life expectancy. But for those who survive early hazards, a life expectancy of sixty or seventy would not be uncommon. For example, a society with a life expectancy of 40 may have few people dying at age 40: most will die before 30 years of age or after 55. In countries with high infant mortality rates, life expectancy at birth is highly sensitive to the rate of death in the first few years of life. Because of this sensitivity to infant mortality, simple life expectancy at age zero can be subjected to gross misinterpretation, leading one to believe that a population with a low overall life expectancy will necessarily have a small proportion of older people. For example, in a hypothetical stationary population in which half the population dies before the age of five, but everybody else dies at exactly 70 years old, the life expectancy at age zero will be about 36 years, while about 25% of the population will be between the ages of 50 and 70. Another measure, such as life expectancy at age 5, can be used to exclude the effect of infant mortality to provide a simple measure of overall mortality rates other than in early childhood - in the hypothetical population above, life expectancy at age 5 would be another 65 years. Aggregate population measures, such as the proportion of the population in various age groups, should also be used alongside individual-based measures like formal life expectancy when analyzing population structure and dynamics.", "score": 1}, {"text": "Most of the people living in phenomenon . because of their personal life they are facing meny problem and diffent level . now this days all people affected to some other issue. they are execpting good phenomenon their life.", "score": 0}, {"text": "according to my point of view people are more healthy because of gym or physical fittness ,thats why people are living more.this is a good thing that they are fit.this is sometime very dangerous for our enivornment.our enivorment use many type of gases that harm oyur society so that totally affect the life of a man.most of them uses harmful medicine that also led to increase the increase the life of a person.so many new technology was increasing day by day to live a long life.to live a long life we have to make our body fit . physical fittness is one of the most important thing for the enivorment to live a long and a happy life.", "score": 1}, {"text": "In daily life the polution are very fast created like cae,vehicals , they are many people are hard problem are created and the middel vresion people are not care in life", "score": 0}, {"text": "In general, people are living longer now.Discuss the causes of this phenomenon.Use specific reasons and details to develop your essay.", "score": 0}, {"text": "Death is one of the unevitable things to happen in our lives.

Indian pharmaceutical companies have played a major role in improving the access to medicines by manufacturing life saving drugs such as ARTs for HIV patients and cancer drugs at a fraction of the cost of the same drugs manufactured in the West. Even global health institutions such as the World Health Organisation (WHO) distributes generic good quality medicines in developing nations such as African countries, India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh which have been plagued by AIDS, multi-drug resistent TB and other chronic illnesses. Better access to medicines has helped raise life expectancy. In addition to improved access, the WHO is working with governments throughout the world to develop health programmes with an aim to make healthcare facilities available to the poor. They work in tandem with local non-profits, NGOs, village and local governments to implement national health policies and encourage a positive and scientific attitude towards health. This has had a positive impact on the health of people in various age groups and has resulted in reducing child mortality rates, therefore extending the number of years people live. Also, national health programmes such as Obamacare in the United States, the universal healthcare programme in United Kingdom and a more indigenous example and the DOTS tuberculosis control programme have helped improved access to healthcare by providing cheap and free healthcare facilities to every member of the society, regardless of his or her income.
