Before and all the life span of a human was 100years and later it turned to 90 and then 80, this was made as 70 soon and hardly now the life span of a person is nearly 60 and there are only few who have a long life span.This decrease in level of life span is due to the adoptation of new culture and which also includes their food culture which is totally not suitable for our national. so due to these reasons, man started to face nameless diseases and this leads to sooner death. This kind of health problems were started to be cured by the invention of new medicines and also some times by imported medicines. Apart from everything,sugar,blood pressure,kidney stone and heart attack are the major problems faced by this generation humans. since, all the diseases doesn't have medicines to be cured but they can partialy increase the life span of the humans. obesity is not considered as a disease where many advanced equipments are available which will suck out the unwanted calories and fat out but this precess is also a very costly process. if a person had got any fire injuries means they can immediately undergo plastic surgeries which may bring back their own face are a new one.

In the Bronze and Iron Age life expectancy was 26; the 2010 world average was 67.2. In Swaziland the average is 49.42 years; in Japan it is 82.6 years. The combination of high infant mortality and deaths in young adulthood from accidents, epidemics, plagues, wars, and childbirth, particularly before modern medicine was widely available, significantly lowers the overall life expectancy. But for those who survive early hazards, a life expectancy of sixty or seventy would not be uncommon. For example, a society with a life expectancy of 40 may have few people dying at age 40: most will die before 30 years of age or after 55. In countries with high infant mortality rates, life expectancy at birth is highly sensitive to the rate of death in the first few years of life. Because of this sensitivity to infant mortality, simple life expectancy at age zero can be subjected to gross misinterpretation, leading one to believe that a population with a low overall life expectancy will necessarily have a small proportion of older people. For example, in a hypothetical stationary population in which half the population dies before the age of five, but everybody else dies at exactly 70 years old, the life expectancy at age zero will be about 36 years, while about 25% of the population will be between the ages of 50 and 70. Another measure, such as life expectancy at age 5, can be used to exclude the effect of infant mortality to provide a simple measure of overall mortality rates other than in early childhood - in the hypothetical population above, life expectancy at age 5 would be another 65 years. Aggregate population measures, such as the proportion of the population in various age groups, should also be used alongside individual-based measures like formal life expectancy when analyzing population structure and dynamics.", "score": 1}, {"text": "In search of better life,people are living longer from home.Those people who left their native places due to the lack of good education,poor medical services as well as transportation problems.Most of the people living longer because of their job in big cities.As a result of these population of cities rare increasing rapidly.People wants to live their life with all modern facilities which are easily available in metro cities.Due to this people start to leave their home and living longer.Also interested people used to go abroad for high education and jobs.One of the main reason of peoples living longer is unemployment and job security.", "score": 1}, {"text": "Nowadays, the lifestyle of the people has changed to a great extent as compared to the olden days.

The reason is that they tried to live by nature, solely depending upon nature. We know the we cannot live without nature. Let us find the some of the reason why they were able to live longer,healthy and hygienically. I firmly believe that there is a creator of nature who has organized it perfectly to help humankind live healthier. So much of scientific inventions has deviated man away from nature. The food habits, the living style, dresses we wear. All of these has affected our health which reduces our lifetime. Our Body is like a machine that is designed to be systematic. God has created us like that by nature, It is very well organized. I am not a science student, but I can explain some of the basic things. Initially our digestive system is wondrous mechanism that is supernaturally created by God. As soon as we eat, when we intake food, it is ready to process the digestion. This is not by our order, it is done automatically, I believe it is the control of God. But as the science evolution started, we started developing varieties of colorful and delicious food, Our digestive system is loaded very much and that is the reason there is so much of diseases like Diabetes, obesity etc. The natural foods are harmless, the fruits, vegetables. They don't ruin our health. But these modern spicy Pizzas, burgers and so much. These are that that spoiled our body and reduced our lifetime. MAJOR REASONS ON FOOD THAT AFFECTS OUR LIFE PERIOD : * jun * contaminated foods. *Artificial attractions and colors that affects our body. We can live longer only if we only intake that is natural which has so much minerals without any side effects in future.

With health advice and medicines accessible for all and that too within one or two mile radius from their localities, people have understood the age old wisdom of \"prevention is better than cure\". Also, with high levels of technological advancements and higher amounts of research to eliminate deadly bacteria and virus, one can safely assume the life span of an average human being will increase two-fold. Thirdly, the point to be noted is the present day awareness surrounding the world population. hundred years back, people wouldn't have had an ounce of knowledge about a common cold or an influenze symptom. Today, even a five year old kid can name the virus responsible AIDS. Understanding the causes of development is complex and very discreet at the same time.

Several other factors have also contributed to the increased longevity of individuals like better health facilities available to the people, in general at affordable rates, inreased service rates of ambulances leading to lower casualties overall, an almost elimination of some diseases like tuberculosis etc. Also, social media has played a humongous role in informing people about the daily exercises and routines they need to adopt in order to lead a healthy life.
