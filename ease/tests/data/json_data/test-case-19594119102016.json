The reason is that they tried to live by nature, solely depending upon nature. We know the we cannot live without nature. Let us find the some of the reason why they were able to live longer,healthy and hygienically. I firmly believe that there is a creator of nature who has organized it perfectly to help humankind live healthier. So much of scientific inventions has deviated man away from nature. The food habits, the living style, dresses we wear. All of these has affected our health which reduces our lifetime. Our Body is like a machine that is designed to be systematic. God has created us like that by nature, It is very well organized. I am not a science student, but I can explain some of the basic things. Initially our digestive system is wondrous mechanism that is supernaturally created by God. As soon as we eat, when we intake food, it is ready to process the digestion. This is not by our order, it is done automatically, I believe it is the control of God. But as the science evolution started, we started developing varieties of colorful and delicious food, Our digestive system is loaded very much and that is the reason there is so much of diseases like Diabetes, obesity etc. The natural foods are harmless, the fruits, vegetables. They don't ruin our health. But these modern spicy Pizzas, burgers and so much. These are that that spoiled our body and reduced our lifetime. MAJOR REASONS ON FOOD THAT AFFECTS OUR LIFE PERIOD : * jun * contaminated foods. *Artificial attractions and colors that affects our body. We can live longer only if we only intake that is natural which has so much minerals without any side effects in future.

Every individual seeks to make his life better in every way possible due to which we have also observed a growing market for organic and healthy food, fitness centres,yoga classes, etc. Slowly and staedily people have accepted these activities into their daily normal lifesytyle and the benefits are being surely reaped. The Life- expectancy ratio has considerably enhanced over the years in various countries because of the adoption of a more organized lifestyle. Other point worth noting to support the statement and underline the reason is that a lot of countries which were plagued by poverty, lower standard of living and unhygienic contditions have been slowly moving on a developing path wherein conditions have become a lot better as compared to the 20 years past. Steps taken by developing countries such as India in the recent times to develop the nation and the interests of the people therein, in the form of providing better living conditions, hygiene care and reduction of poverty has indirectly increased the life- expectancy rate in India. Similarly, such enhanced living conditions have definitely led topeople living healthier and longer. A famous personality once said,\"A healthy heart and a healthy mind are the paths to success\".

And in such nations, people are not having the increased life span this question is talking about. These are mostly the countries where there is dictatorship. Coming back to those egions where the life expectancy has actually risen in the past decaded, it seems to be a result of several causes. One of them is advancements in medical science. This advancement in medical science has further been facilitated by easy flow of information and knowledge accross the globe through advancements in information and communication technology. This has allowed to bring ideas and practices from even far off locations to learn from each other and advance. Another cause can be better knowledge management skills developed by the scholars of this era. This lets the world leaders realize the importance of structuring their action plans in a way that millitary battles have substantially reduced. For how long, this remains to be seen though. Hopefully for a long time. And all this depends on ability of our world leader to recognize world patterns and proactively act in a way so as to be able to successfully avoid conflicts. This replacement of milltary competetion with economic one has led to less war casualities. This has further been facilitated by nuclear deterents now being possesed by almost all major international powers. At the same time, this economic battle in some cases leads to the exploitation of pwerless masses in countries without democracy, which in turn leads to lesser life expectancy. A paradox apparently! Another reason for longer life expectancy can be - the increased ease of learning new skills. This has been made possible by better connectivity through internet, and efficient transport channels available.
