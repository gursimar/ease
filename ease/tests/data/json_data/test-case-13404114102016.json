Development of any nation does not only depends on per capita income but actually on standard of living of its residents and this has formed the basis of development of HDI. An average increase in life expectancy years can be seen through records and there have been multiple changes in the society which support this increase. 1. Recent researches show that population below poverty line in India has been reduced to about 12% only which was more than 30% some decades ago. Spending power has increased and hence people utilise this increase in resources to maintain their well-being. 2. Globalisation has allowed MNC's to setup their offices across borders & as per international policies, companies also provide health cover to employees and their family members. This is also an important factor as formal systems have been established which make accessiblity to medical services easier. 3. Government has also taken commendable steps to improve the situation. Government Dispenceries have been opened on large scale which provide better health facilities to poor at affordable costs in just a few kilometers reach. 4. Government also provides health services to its employees as well. Large number of families across India get direct benefit from such policies which eventually increase in nhigher life expactancy. 5. Better educational standards have created better doctors and better researches have generated better medicines to cure dreadful diseases like cancer.
