However, another important factor is our knowledge of their importance to our health and life expectancy, and of the steps we can take to ensure that we lead a healthy lifestyle. Out access to relevant information has also improved dramatically as a result of scientific research and methods of information like the internet.

The reason is that they tried to live by nature, solely depending upon nature. We know the we cannot live without nature. Let us find the some of the reason why they were able to live longer,healthy and hygienically. I firmly believe that there is a creator of nature who has organized it perfectly to help humankind live healthier. So much of scientific inventions has deviated man away from nature. The food habits, the living style, dresses we wear. All of these has affected our health which reduces our lifetime. Our Body is like a machine that is designed to be systematic. God has created us like that by nature, It is very well organized. I am not a science student, but I can explain some of the basic things. Initially our digestive system is wondrous mechanism that is supernaturally created by God. As soon as we eat, when we intake food, it is ready to process the digestion. This is not by our order, it is done automatically, I believe it is the control of God. But as the science evolution started, we started developing varieties of colorful and delicious food, Our digestive system is loaded very much and that is the reason there is so much of diseases like Diabetes, obesity etc. The natural foods are harmless, the fruits, vegetables. They don't ruin our health. But these modern spicy Pizzas, burgers and so much. These are that that spoiled our body and reduced our lifetime. MAJOR REASONS ON FOOD THAT AFFECTS OUR LIFE PERIOD : * jun * contaminated foods. *Artificial attractions and colors that affects our body. We can live longer only if we only intake that is natural which has so much minerals without any side effects in future. I would rather live in a forest to eat fruits, vegetables which are moderate tasty and live longer than to devour modern foods that are spicy and delicious and die soon.", "score": 0}, {"text": "I disagree to the fact that people live longer now. Unlikely in the earlier days, we get to see men and women live less longer in modern world. Earlier, the life expectancy ranged to 70-80 years but now it has come down to less than 50 years. The amount of diseases and iniquities has go up the ozone level that each day we see people die of cancer, tumor, cardiac arrests and so on. it was just yesterday i was been told to pray for one uncle of mine who was affected with a disease which the hospital officials could not even diagonise the fatal disease. The list does not end there. It goes on and on. The causes due to such early dismissal in life is mainly because of the food intake by the people. The amount of junk food, instant feeding systems, burgers with extra cheese and fries contributes to the above. We see even village dhabas have upgraded to another level but the food which they provide is not much of hygiene and declined sanitary working conditions. also pollution in terms of air, water, soil has gone up to another level where people inhale polluted air and water leading them to chronic water infections, respiratory ailments etc. Also, the people consuming the amount of smoke and alcohol has increased over the years. this leads to major lung disease, cardiac arrest, kidney failures and the list can be expanded. i do not see that people live longer now than the olden times. But the fact that lots of new medicines and curies is being developed every day. Lots of medical experiments as well trial outs make people live longer. Cancer centers and home care treatment which give special care to the patients make it cancer a much curable disease now. Thanks to technology and the brilliant minds of the doctors and researchers all over the world. Initiatives and measures can be taken to prevent the intake of beer.

GOOD MEDICAL FACILITIES: The field of medical science has shown a major revolution. Nowadays there are medicines for almost all the diseases. For the diseases that cannot be cured using medicines, there are several surgical methods. Medical Engineering helps in the manufacture of precise surgical equipments. In some surgeries, robots that make use of artificial intelligence has proved to work successfully with greater accuracy in operation than human surgeons. OTHER REASONS: Apart from good medical facilities, there are few other reasons that play a major role in improving the life expectancy of human beings. (i) Food: Earlier days people used to eat food directly from the sources like plants or animals. Nowadays food is processed before consumption. Milk is pasteurized to remove bacteria. Sugar and salt are purified to get clear crystals. Likewise all the food items and water are properly purified to make it free of micro organisms like virus or bacteria. (ii) Neat and clean environment: The environment that we live in is sanitized well by the government. The government also takes efforts to reduce the mosquitoes by spraying chemicals and closing the drainages. Mosquitoes are parasites that are mainly responsible for several diseases like Malaria, Dengue, Cholera, Typhoid, some of which are deadly.

Yes, as compared to two decades back, we lacked medical expertise, innovative treatment and safety measures. The growth of medical industry, technological advancements etc have led to the enhancement and betterment of the health conditions of the patients. The various prime issues of health were cancer, AIDS and such. But, now things have changed drastically. There are medications done for cancer by which a patient can survive. As compared to decades back, people died due to cancer becuase there was no medication for it. But, now due to the technological advancement and researchs done by the scientists has helped in saving many lives. The other reason is education. Back in 80's people hardly knew about safety measures and they dint knew about how they could resist a heartattack or cardiac arrest. But now people are aware of the safety and precautionary measures that can be taken during mishaps. Also, the growth in the service sector has led to better health facilities. 24*7 Ambulance service and innovative hygiene techniques are some. The rise in the economy and earning capacity has also increased the rise in the health conditions of the people. People in early 80's weren't educated and couldn't afford bills. People nowadays can afford medical treatment in abroad too. The promotions of the health industries have educated the people to adopt hygiene techniques and to control the risk of getting infected.

Major contributiors to this are the steps actively taken by governments to reduce infant mortality and pregnancy mortality rates of women, which were leading to death during pregnancy. Several other factors have also contributed to the increased longevity of individuals like better health facilities available to the people, in general at affordable rates, inreased service rates of ambulances leading to lower casualties overall, an almost elimination of some diseases like tuberculosis etc. Also, social media has played a humongous role in informing people about the daily exercises and routines they need to adopt in order to lead a healthy life. Various forums on internet are used to share such information. Also, the rise of health maintenance practices suh as 'Yoga' have served as a major cause among the masees by making them actively engage in taking good care of their own selves. Various other campaigns for breast cancer, uteral cancer etc. have enabled women to be informed about such diseases and has helped several women to diagnose such diseases in early stages. Companies today also employ annual health check-up policies which help the employees take good care of their own. One intangible aspect that has resulted intoincreased longevity is the rise in income levels of people, in general. Not only has medical assistance become more affordable, it has also led to better retirement planning by individuals which has enabled them to live satisfactorily even post retirement, with sufficient amount of funds to sustain and lead a healthy life. Thus, steps actively taken by the governments along with rising awareness regarding health and diseases by various media has helped people lead healthy lives.", "score": 6}, {"text":
