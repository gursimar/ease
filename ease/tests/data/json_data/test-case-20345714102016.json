Machines that are being used in the hospital as well are well-equipped and maintained to offer high-end service for patients seeking for hospital admission. The sanitation is also deemed with much importance in the hospital so as not to aggravate the condition of sick patients. In addition to that, microorganims are being minimized by continuously abiding to hospital sanitation and policy.

One of the reasons this has happened is because of the availability of generic medicines. Indian pharmaceutical companies have played a major role in improving the access to medicines by manufacturing life saving drugs such as ARTs for HIV patients and cancer drugs at a fraction of the cost of the same drugs manufactured in the West. Even global health institutions such as the World Health Organisation (WHO) distributes generic good quality medicines in developing nations such as African countries, India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh which have been plagued by AIDS, multi-drug resistent TB and other chronic illnesses. Better access to medicines has helped raise life expectancy. In addition to improved access, the WHO is working with governments throughout the world to develop health programmes with an aim to make healthcare facilities available to the poor. They work in tandem with local non-profits, NGOs, village and local governments to implement national health policies and encourage a positive and scientific attitude towards health. This has had a positive impact on the health of people in various age groups and has resulted in reducing child mortality rates, therefore extending the number of years people live. Also, national health programmes such as Obamacare in the United States, the universal healthcare programme in United Kingdom and a more indigenous example and the DOTS tuberculosis control programme have helped improved access to healthcare by providing cheap and free healthcare facilities to every member of the society, regardless of his or her income.

The list does not end there. It goes on and on. The causes due to such early dismissal in life is mainly because of the food intake by the people. The amount of junk food, instant feeding systems, burgers with extra cheese and fries contributes to the above. We see even village dhabas have upgraded to another level but the food which they provide is not much of hygiene and declined sanitary working conditions. also pollution in terms of air, water, soil has gone up to another level where people inhale polluted air and water leading them to chronic water infections, respiratory ailments etc. Also, the people consuming the amount of smoke and alcohol has increased over the years. this leads to major lung disease, cardiac arrest, kidney failures and the list can be expanded. i do not see that people live longer now than the olden times.

With health advice and medicines accessible for all and that too within one or two mile radius from their localities, people have understood the age old wisdom of \"prevention is better than cure\". Also, with high levels of technological advancements and higher amounts of research to eliminate deadly bacteria and virus, one can safely assume the life span of an average human being will increase two-fold.

Today, even a five year old kid can name the virus responsible AIDS. Understanding the causes of development is complex and very discreet at the same time. Vaccines were developed understanding the effect of the bacteria on animals. As rightly said by many, \"necessity is the mother of all inventions\". With the necessity to eliminate and eradicate deadly diseases, scientists all around the world have worked and are continuously working to make the world a better and healthy place to live in. In this process, immunization to various bacteria has helped man indirectly to live a long and also a health life. Also, Education can be cited as an important cause of this phenomenon.

In the Bronze and Iron Age life expectancy was 26; the 2010 world average was 67.2. In Swaziland the average is 49.42 years; in Japan it is 82.6 years. The combination of high infant mortality and deaths in young adulthood from accidents, epidemics, plagues, wars, and childbirth, particularly before modern medicine was widely available, significantly lowers the overall life expectancy. But for those who survive early hazards, a life expectancy of sixty or seventy would not be uncommon. For example, a society with a life expectancy of 40 may have few people dying at age 40: most will die before 30 years of age or after 55. In countries with high infant mortality rates, life expectancy at birth is highly sensitive to the rate of death in the first few years of life. Because of this sensitivity to infant mortality, simple life expectancy at age zero can be subjected to gross misinterpretation, leading one to believe that a population with a low overall life expectancy will necessarily have a small proportion of older people. For example, in a hypothetical stationary population in which half the population dies before the age of five, but everybody else dies at exactly 70 years old, the life expectancy at age zero will be about 36 years, while about 25% of the population will be between the ages of 50 and 70. Another measure, such as life expectancy at age 5, can be used to exclude the effect of infant mortality to provide a simple measure of overall mortality rates other than in early childhood - in the hypothetical population above, life expectancy at age 5 would be another 65 years.

Development of any nation does not only depends on per capita income but actually on standard of living of its residents and this has formed the basis of development of HDI. An average increase in life expectancy years can be seen through records and there have been multiple changes in the society which support this increase. 1. Recent researches show that population below poverty line in India has been reduced to about 12% only which was more than 30% some decades ago. Spending power has increased and hence people utilise this increase in resources to maintain their well-being. 2. Globalisation has allowed MNC's to setup their offices across borders & as per international policies, companies also provide health cover to employees and their family members. This is also an important factor as formal systems have been established which make accessiblity to medical services easier. 3. Government has also taken commendable steps to improve the situation. Government Dispenceries have been opened on large scale which provide better health facilities to poor at affordable costs in just a few kilometers reach. 4. Government also provides health services to its employees as well. Large number of families across India get direct benefit from such policies which eventually increase in nhigher life expactancy. 5. Better educational standards have created better doctors and better researches have generated better medicines to cure dreadful diseases like cancer. Initially there was a huge problem of access to good doctors & medicines. 6. Reach of media through every form has increased exponentially in past decades. This eventually means that now awareness programs reach more people and more people use this knowledge to take care of their health.", "score": 5}, {"text":
