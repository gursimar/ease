[{"text": "When you observe in an overall basis , people live longer now not because there are no problems or diseases but because the technology has increased this much that every problem has its solution. Firstly , if we bring into our notice during olden days people were hardly concerned about their life , they just wanted to live for the sake of living because that time the generation was different , they had no aim and no reasons to live . But when we look on the overall basis today everyone has their opinion, their way of living and no one wants to just die rather achieve something and live longer. it was always said that good health always leads you to a good path. before it was difficult for the prople to undersatand but now even from a child till the old people , everyone has realised the importance of good health and the purpose living No one can predict that for how many years someone's going to live but a person can surely increase his life span by having a good health, maintaing his pysique , and having a happy life . resons of living longer is just a simple thing be happy always , reduce stress and for reducing stress best solution is doing excercise regularly ( yoga ) . since people are living longer automatically they get into the fact that yes they have to do something in their life. today their is no age limit for anything. old people who couldnt study in their age are completing their degrees in various forms. and they realise that how much is life important to them. its all about human tendency to begin and proceed in their life in which way. The other reason which can be is reduction in intake of tabacco and alchol . though people intake it but they know their limits and in addition todays technology is reaching the hieghts there is no problem which cannot be cured. The causes of this phenomenon is that as people are living longer the values cultures beliefs etc is still existing in this world. because when you compare a joint family will be more discipline and decent compared to nuclear family .LIVING LONGER is just the matter of thinking. its all about how you live your life , in which way and when you die you know that you have achieved something in your life.", "score": 4}, {"text": "Now a days peoples are living longer because in their time of growing means when they where growing they where hardwoking in farms their self only.That time there was no more growth of population that now a days causing very much.now a days lack of the products which is needed to eat,every thing is mixed it is not god for our body.Now a days there no more exercise that can be don from a human being \"It is car to carpet\", work.

In the Bronze and Iron Age life expectancy was 26; the 2010 world average was 67.2. In Swaziland the average is 49.42 years; in Japan it is 82.6 years. The combination of high infant mortality and deaths in young adulthood from accidents, epidemics, plagues, wars, and childbirth, particularly before modern medicine was widely available, significantly lowers the overall life expectancy. But for those who survive early hazards, a life expectancy of sixty or seventy would not be uncommon. For example, a society with a life expectancy of 40 may have few people dying at age 40: most will die before 30 years of age or after 55. In countries with high infant mortality rates, life expectancy at birth is highly sensitive to the rate of death in the first few years of life. Because of this sensitivity to infant mortality, simple life expectancy at age zero can be subjected to gross misinterpretation, leading one to believe that a population with a low overall life expectancy will necessarily have a small proportion of older people. For example, in a hypothetical stationary population in which half the population dies before the age of five, but everybody else dies at exactly 70 years old, the life expectancy at age zero will be about 36 years, while about 25% of the population will be between the ages of 50 and 70. Another measure, such as life expectancy at age 5, can be used to exclude the effect of infant mortality to provide a simple measure of overall mortality rates other than in early childhood - in the hypothetical population above, life expectancy at age 5 would be another 65 years. Aggregate population measures, such as the proportion of the population in various age groups, should also be used alongside individual-based measures like formal life expectancy when analyzing population structure and dynamics.", "score": 1}, {"text": "Improved access to healthcare has risen the number of years we live The advancements in technology in the fiel of medicine has not just benefited the rich and the affluent, but it also has trickled down to developing nations. One of the reasons this has happened is because of the availability of generic medicines. Indian pharmaceutical companies have played a major role in improving the access to medicines by manufacturing life saving drugs such as ARTs for HIV patients and cancer drugs at a fraction of the cost of the same drugs manufactured in the West. Even global health institutions such as the World Health Organisation (WHO) distributes generic good quality medicines in developing nations such as African countries, India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh which have been plagued by AIDS, multi-drug resistent TB and other chronic illnesses. Better access to medicines has helped raise life expectancy. In addition to improved access, the WHO is working with governments throughout the world to develop health programmes with an aim to make healthcare facilities available to the poor. They work in tandem with local non-profits, NGOs, village and local governments to implement national health policies and encourage a positive and scientific attitude towards health. This has had a positive impact on the health of people in various age groups and has resulted in reducing child mortality rates, therefore extending the number of years people live. Also, national health programmes such as Obamacare in the United States, the universal healthcare programme in United Kingdom and a more indigenous example and the DOTS tuberculosis control programme have helped improved access to healthcare by providing cheap and free healthcare facilities to every member of the society, regardless of his or her income.

It has become common to see people with age more than 80 years. Lets discuss some of the major reasons for this improvement. GOOD MEDICAL FACILITIES: The field of medical science has shown a major revolution. Nowadays there are medicines for almost all the diseases. For the diseases that cannot be cured using medicines, there are several surgical methods. Medical Engineering helps in the manufacture of precise surgical equipments. In some surgeries, robots that make use of artificial intelligence has proved to work successfully with greater accuracy in operation than human surgeons. OTHER REASONS: Apart from good medical facilities, there are few other reasons that play a major role in improving the life expectancy of human beings. (i) Food: Earlier days people used to eat food directly from the sources like plants or animals. Nowadays food is processed before consumption. Milk is pasteurized to remove bacteria. Sugar and salt are purified to get clear crystals. Likewise all the food items and water are properly purified to make it free of micro organisms like virus or bacteria. (ii) Neat and clean environment: The environment that we live in is sanitized well by the government. The government also takes efforts to reduce the mosquitoes by spraying chemicals and closing the drainages.
