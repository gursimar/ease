GOOD MEDICAL FACILITIES: The field of medical science has shown a major revolution. Nowadays there are medicines for almost all the diseases. For the diseases that cannot be cured using medicines, there are several surgical methods. Medical Engineering helps in the manufacture of precise surgical equipments. In some surgeries, robots that make use of artificial intelligence has proved to work successfully with greater accuracy in operation than human surgeons. OTHER REASONS: Apart from good medical facilities, there are few other reasons that play a major role in improving the life expectancy of human beings. (i) Food: Earlier days people used to eat food directly from the sources like plants or animals. Nowadays food is processed before consumption. Milk is pasteurized to remove bacteria. Sugar and salt are purified to get clear crystals. Likewise all the food items and water are properly purified to make it free of micro organisms like virus or bacteria. (ii) Neat and clean environment: The environment that we live in is sanitized well by the government. The government also takes efforts to reduce the mosquitoes by spraying chemicals and closing the drainages. Mosquitoes are parasites that are mainly responsible for several diseases like Malaria, Dengue, Cholera, Typhoid, some of which are deadly.
