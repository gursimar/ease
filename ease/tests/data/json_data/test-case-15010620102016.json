[{"text": "REASONS FOR INCREASE IN LIFE EXPECTANCY: INTRODUCTION: It can be very well inferred from the census that the average life expectancy of people has drastically increased. It has become common to see people with age more than 80 years. Lets discuss some of the major reasons for this improvement. GOOD MEDICAL FACILITIES: The field of medical science has shown a major revolution. Nowadays there are medicines for almost all the diseases. For the diseases that cannot be cured using medicines, there are several surgical methods. Medical Engineering helps in the manufacture of precise surgical equipments. In some surgeries, robots that make use of artificial intelligence has proved to work successfully with greater accuracy in operation than human surgeons. OTHER REASONS: Apart from good medical facilities, there are few other reasons that play a major role in improving the life expectancy of human beings. (i) Food: Earlier days people used to eat food directly from the sources like plants or animals. Nowadays food is processed before consumption. Milk is pasteurized to remove bacteria. Sugar and salt are purified to get clear crystals. Likewise all the food items and water are properly purified to make it free of micro organisms like virus or bacteria. (ii) Neat and clean environment: The environment that we live in is sanitized well by the government. The government also takes efforts to reduce the mosquitoes by spraying chemicals and closing the drainages. Mosquitoes are parasites that are mainly responsible for several diseases like Malaria, Dengue, Cholera, Typhoid, some of which are deadly. CONCLUSION: Thus it can be inferred that the life expectancy of people could be increased day by day with development in technology and cooperation of people in making the environment a cleaner and safer place to live in.", "score": 5}, {"text": "As of todays way of living people are living longer because some people are now generally consious about their healtth problems , i can say by the help also of media, advertisements, and campaigns for a healthy and fit lifestyle.

There is an other statement which tells that clapping helps a person to stay fit and it keeps one's mind calm and relaxed so it is better to clap daily for atleast 20 minutes which tunes up our mind so that we can do any work with enthusiasm and with full confidence. We have to advice our children to clap daily which will make their handwriting good and helps them to be active always.

We know the we cannot live without nature. Let us find the some of the reason why they were able to live longer,healthy and hygienically. I firmly believe that there is a creator of nature who has organized it perfectly to help humankind live healthier. So much of scientific inventions has deviated man away from nature. The food habits, the living style, dresses we wear. All of these has affected our health which reduces our lifetime. Our Body is like a machine that is designed to be systematic. God has created us like that by nature, It is very well organized. I am not a science student, but I can explain some of the basic things. Initially our digestive system is wondrous mechanism that is supernaturally created by God. As soon as we eat, when we intake food, it is ready to process the digestion. This is not by our order, it is done automatically, I believe it is the control of God. But as the science evolution started, we started developing varieties of colorful and delicious food, Our digestive system is loaded very much and that is the reason there is so much of diseases like Diabetes, obesity etc. The natural foods are harmless, the fruits, vegetables. They don't ruin our health. But these modern spicy Pizzas, burgers and so much. These are that that spoiled our body and reduced our lifetime. MAJOR REASONS ON FOOD THAT AFFECTS OUR LIFE PERIOD : * jun * contaminated foods. *Artificial attractions and colors that affects our body.

Education has taken a toll on student's life in today's world.a person judged on your degrees,marks, percentage, ranks. it defines how serious or committed a person is towards its work. Everyone around starts pestering a student and would expect him to study for hours. He no more can have an ecstatic carefree life, unlike our ancestors. Our ancestors would engage themselves by playing outdoor games like gilli danda, called cricket today, kabadi, sitolya and wouldn't be stuck in front of laptop working on their assignments or television watching sitcoms. the excessive competition has simply imbalanced a child's life and a person is put to stress from the very first stage of life. Reportedly, the number of suicides due to stress has increased dramatically. Stress is one of the major concerns today. it is one of the major reasons for living shorter today. one should strike a balance between education and co-curricular to stay healthy and fit. it is very important to work out and keep one's body fit to live longer. Further more, the introduction of junk food has ruined the diet of people today. People today are so fond of burgers, pizzas amd maggi, that it has become their staple food. they get obese and unhealthy and unwanted diseases are called for, which in turn curtails a person's life.

In the Bronze and Iron Age life expectancy was 26; the 2010 world average was 67.2. In Swaziland the average is 49.42 years; in Japan it is 82.6 years. The combination of high infant mortality and deaths in young adulthood from accidents, epidemics, plagues, wars, and childbirth, particularly before modern medicine was widely available, significantly lowers the overall life expectancy. But for those who survive early hazards, a life expectancy of sixty or seventy would not be uncommon. For example, a society with a life expectancy of 40 may have few people dying at age 40: most will die before 30 years of age or after 55. In countries with high infant mortality rates, life expectancy at birth is highly sensitive to the rate of death in the first few years of life. Because of this sensitivity to infant mortality, simple life expectancy at age zero can be subjected to gross misinterpretation, leading one to believe that a population with a low overall life expectancy will necessarily have a small proportion of older people. For example, in a hypothetical stationary population in which half the population dies before the age of five, but everybody else dies at exactly 70 years old, the life expectancy at age zero will be about 36 years, while about 25% of the population will be between the ages of 50 and 70. Another measure, such as life expectancy at age 5, can be used to exclude the effect of infant mortality to provide a simple measure of overall mortality rates other than in early childhood - in the hypothetical population above, life expectancy at age 5 would be another 65 years. Aggregate population measures, such as the proportion of the population in various age groups, should also be used alongside individual-based measures like formal life expectancy when analyzing population structure and dynamics.", "score": 1}, {"text": "Death is one of the unevitable things to happen in our lives.

And in such nations, people are not having the increased life span this question is talking about. These are mostly the countries where there is dictatorship. Coming back to those egions where the life expectancy has actually risen in the past decaded, it seems to be a result of several causes. One of them is advancements in medical science. This advancement in medical science has further been facilitated by easy flow of information and knowledge accross the globe through advancements in information and communication technology. This has allowed to bring ideas and practices from even far off locations to learn from each other and advance. Another cause can be better knowledge management skills developed by the scholars of this era. This lets the world leaders realize the importance of structuring their action plans in a way that millitary battles have substantially reduced. For how long, this remains to be seen though. Hopefully for a long time. And all this depends on ability of our world leader to recognize world patterns and proactively act in a way so as to be able to successfully avoid conflicts. This replacement of milltary competetion with economic one has led to less war casualities. This has further been facilitated by nuclear deterents now being possesed by almost all major international powers. At the same time, this economic battle in some cases leads to the exploitation of pwerless masses in countries without democracy, which in turn leads to lesser life expectancy. A paradox apparently! Another reason for longer life expectancy can be - the increased ease of learning new skills. This has been made possible by better connectivity through internet, and efficient transport channels available.
