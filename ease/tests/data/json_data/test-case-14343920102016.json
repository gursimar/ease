But it's equally true that there are still cases of regions in the world where exploitation of masses by a few people closer to the strong holds of power is continuing. And in such nations, people are not having the increased life span this question is talking about. These are mostly the countries where there is dictatorship. Coming back to those egions where the life expectancy has actually risen in the past decaded, it seems to be a result of several causes. One of them is advancements in medical science. This advancement in medical science has further been facilitated by easy flow of information and knowledge accross the globe through advancements in information and communication technology. This has allowed to bring ideas and practices from even far off locations to learn from each other and advance. Another cause can be better knowledge management skills developed by the scholars of this era. This lets the world leaders realize the importance of structuring their action plans in a way that millitary battles have substantially reduced. For how long, this remains to be seen though. Hopefully for a long time. And all this depends on ability of our world leader to recognize world patterns and proactively act in a way so as to be able to successfully avoid conflicts. This replacement of milltary competetion with economic one has led to less war casualities. This has further been facilitated by nuclear deterents now being possesed by almost all major international powers. At the same time, this economic battle in some cases leads to the exploitation of pwerless masses in countries without democracy, which in turn leads to lesser life expectancy. A paradox apparently! Another reason for longer life expectancy can be - the increased ease of learning new skills. This has been made possible by better connectivity through internet, and efficient transport channels available. Research has proven that the longest living masses were those who were able to gather enough will to learn more and more, who never stopped learning, in every form- actions, reflection of actions, exploration for better options for actions, etc.", "score": 6}, {"text": "Now a days people are living longer now because of their cautiousness.Now a days people are very much aware about their life and people are doing that which will make them to live longer.People are doing yoga and meditation which make them fit.And people are very much careful about their food.People are also taking fruits and vegetables which make them healthy.Main disease is tension, if any body is having any tension then that cant cured by the doctor.Now a days many people are spending their time in movies..", "score": 2}, {"text": "When you observe in an overall basis , people live longer now not because there are no problems or diseases but because the technology has increased this much that every problem has its solution.

However nowdays pollution is increasing day by day and all we can do is to find solution at early stage. People are doing Yoga which is one of the best way to keep your self healthy. Nowdays we can easily consult with docotor or anyone about our health problems and according to which we make our diet by which you can live healthy life. However dur to lack of foods, lack of money for medical issues many people lives are not so long. But if we care for our health and if we eat healthy food if we do exercise and Yoga and if we take care of everything related to our health we can also live long despite of such polluted environment. Now we have technology, we have everthing which can help us to live long. The only things we need to do is give proper attention to such things. We can make proper time table for such thing, however many people are not in the favour of doing such things. And people who gives proper attention will live long life. We have many examples seeing which we can apply it and live young, live free. We have everything to live long, some people may say that we dont have enough money to such things; But what I can say is doing Yoga at early morning will snatch your money, many research shows that Yoga is very helpful to us to our health.

The reason is that they tried to live by nature, solely depending upon nature. We know the we cannot live without nature.

I firmly believe that there is a creator of nature who has organized it perfectly to help humankind live healthier. So much of scientific inventions has deviated man away from nature. The food habits, the living style, dresses we wear. All of these has affected our health which reduces our lifetime. Our Body is like a machine that is designed to be systematic. God has created us like that by nature, It is very well organized. I am not a science student, but I can explain some of the basic things. Initially our digestive system is wondrous mechanism that is supernaturally created by God. As soon as we eat, when we intake food, it is ready to process the digestion. This is not by our order, it is done automatically, I believe it is the control of God. But as the science evolution started, we started developing varieties of colorful and delicious food, Our digestive system is loaded very much and that is the reason there is so much of diseases like Diabetes, obesity etc. The natural foods are harmless, the fruits, vegetables. They don't ruin our health. But these modern spicy Pizzas, burgers and so much. These are that that spoiled our body and reduced our lifetime. MAJOR REASONS ON FOOD THAT AFFECTS OUR LIFE PERIOD : * jun * contaminated foods. *Artificial attractions and colors that affects our body.

It has become common to see people with age more than 80 years. Lets discuss some of the major reasons for this improvement. GOOD MEDICAL FACILITIES: The field of medical science has shown a major revolution. Nowadays there are medicines for almost all the diseases. For the diseases that cannot be cured using medicines, there are several surgical methods. Medical Engineering helps in the manufacture of precise surgical equipments. In some surgeries, robots that make use of artificial intelligence has proved to work successfully with greater accuracy in operation than human surgeons. OTHER REASONS: Apart from good medical facilities, there are few other reasons that play a major role in improving the life expectancy of human beings. (i) Food: Earlier days people used to eat food directly from the sources like plants or animals. Nowadays food is processed before consumption. Milk is pasteurized to remove bacteria. Sugar and salt are purified to get clear crystals. Likewise all the food items and water are properly purified to make it free of micro organisms like virus or bacteria. (ii) Neat and clean environment: The environment that we live in is sanitized well by the government. The government also takes efforts to reduce the mosquitoes by spraying chemicals and closing the drainages. Mosquitoes are parasites that are mainly responsible for several diseases like Malaria, Dengue, Cholera, Typhoid, some of which are deadly. CONCLUSION: Thus it can be inferred that the life expectancy of people could be increased day by day with development in technology and cooperation of people in making the environment a cleaner and safer place to live in.", "score": 5}, {"text": "In general,people are living longer now.

Development of any nation does not only depends on per capita income but actually on standard of living of its residents and this has formed the basis of development of HDI. An average increase in life expectancy years can be seen through records and there have been multiple changes in the society which support this increase. 1. Recent researches show that population below poverty line in India has been reduced to about 12% only which was more than 30% some decades ago. Spending power has increased and hence people utilise this increase in resources to maintain their well-being. 2. Globalisation has allowed MNC's to setup their offices across borders & as per international policies, companies also provide health cover to employees and their family members. This is also an important factor as formal systems have been established which make accessiblity to medical services easier. 3. Government has also taken commendable steps to improve the situation. Government Dispenceries have been opened on large scale which provide better health facilities to poor at affordable costs in just a few kilometers reach. 4. Government also provides health services to its employees as well. Large number of families across India get direct benefit from such policies which eventually increase in nhigher life expactancy. 5. Better educational standards have created better doctors and better researches have generated better medicines to cure dreadful diseases like cancer. Initially there was a huge problem of access to good doctors & medicines. 6. Reach of media through every form has increased exponentially in past decades.

Indian pharmaceutical companies have played a major role in improving the access to medicines by manufacturing life saving drugs such as ARTs for HIV patients and cancer drugs at a fraction of the cost of the same drugs manufactured in the West. Even global health institutions such as the World Health Organisation (WHO) distributes generic good quality medicines in developing nations such as African countries, India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh which have been plagued by AIDS, multi-drug resistent TB and other chronic illnesses. Better access to medicines has helped raise life expectancy. In addition to improved access, the WHO is working with governments throughout the world to develop health programmes with an aim to make healthcare facilities available to the poor. They work in tandem with local non-profits, NGOs, village and local governments to implement national health policies and encourage a positive and scientific attitude towards health. This has had a positive impact on the health of people in various age groups and has resulted in reducing child mortality rates, therefore extending the number of years people live.

In the Bronze and Iron Age life expectancy was 26; the 2010 world average was 67.2. In Swaziland the average is 49.42 years; in Japan it is 82.6 years. The combination of high infant mortality and deaths in young adulthood from accidents, epidemics, plagues, wars, and childbirth, particularly before modern medicine was widely available, significantly lowers the overall life expectancy. But for those who survive early hazards, a life expectancy of sixty or seventy would not be uncommon. For example, a society with a life expectancy of 40 may have few people dying at age 40: most will die before 30 years of age or after 55. In countries with high infant mortality rates, life expectancy at birth is highly sensitive to the rate of death in the first few years of life. Because of this sensitivity to infant mortality, simple life expectancy at age zero can be subjected to gross misinterpretation, leading one to believe that a population with a low overall life expectancy will necessarily have a small proportion of older people. For example, in a hypothetical stationary population in which half the population dies before the age of five, but everybody else dies at exactly 70 years old, the life expectancy at age zero will be about 36 years, while about 25% of the population will be between the ages of 50 and 70. Another measure, such as life expectancy at age 5, can be used to exclude the effect of infant mortality to provide a simple measure of overall mortality rates other than in early childhood - in the hypothetical population above, life expectancy at age 5 would be another 65 years. Aggregate population measures, such as the proportion of the population in various age groups, should also be used alongside individual-based measures like formal life expectancy when analyzing population structure and dynamics.", "score": 1}, {"text": "THIS IS THE VERY ACCURATE AND ADVANCE PARAMETER TO IMPROOVE AND CHECK THE MINDS OF A GENRAL STUDENT", "score": 0}, {"text": "People live longer now for several reasons.
