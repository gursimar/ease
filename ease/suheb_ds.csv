"It's true that in developed and developing countries, the people with well-off power status are living longer. But it's equally true that there are still cases of regions in the world where exploitation of masses by a few people closer to the strong holds of power is continuing. And in such nations, people are not having the increased life span this question is talking about. These are mostly the countries where there is dictatorship. Coming back to those egions where the life expectancy has actually risen in the past decaded, it seems to be a result of several causes. One of them is advancements in medical science. This advancement in medical science has further been facilitated by easy flow of information and knowledge accross the globe through advancements in information and communication technology. This has allowed to bring ideas and practices from even far off locations to learn from each other and advance. Another cause can be better knowledge management skills developed by the scholars of this era. This lets the world leaders realize the importance of structuring their action plans in a way that millitary battles have substantially reduced. For how long, this remains to be seen though. Hopefully for a long time. And all this depends on ability of our world leader to recognize world patterns and proactively act in a way so as to be able to successfully avoid conflicts. This replacement of milltary competetion with economic one has led to less war casualities. This has further been facilitated by nuclear deterents now being possesed by almost all major international powers. At the same time, this economic battle in some cases leads to the exploitation of pwerless masses in countries without democracy, which in turn leads to lesser life expectancy. A paradox apparently! Another reason for longer life expectancy can be - the increased ease of learning new skills. This has been made possible by better connectivity through internet, and efficient transport channels available. Research has proven that the longest living masses were those who were able to gather enough will to learn more and more, who never stopped learning, in every form- actions, reflection of actions, exploration for better options for actions, etc.",6
"It is indeed an encouraging fact that the average longevity, which is directly related to better health of individuals across the globe has strikingly increased over the years. Major contributiors to this are the steps actively taken by governments to reduce infant mortality and pregnancy mortality rates of women, which were leading to death during pregnancy. Several other factors have also contributed to the increased longevity of individuals like better health facilities available to the people, in general at affordable rates, inreased service rates of ambulances leading to lower casualties overall, an almost elimination of some diseases like tuberculosis etc. Also, social media has played a humongous role in informing people about the daily exercises and routines they need to adopt in order to lead a healthy life. Various forums on internet are used to share such information. Also, the rise of health maintenance practices suh as 'Yoga' have served as a major cause among the masees by making them actively engage in taking good care of their own selves. Various other campaigns for breast cancer, uteral cancer etc. have enabled women to be informed about such diseases and has helped several women to diagnose such diseases in early stages. Companies today also employ annual health check-up policies which help the employees take good care of their own. One intangible aspect that has resulted intoincreased longevity is the rise in income levels of people, in general. Not only has medical assistance become more affordable, it has also led to better retirement planning by individuals which has enabled them to live satisfactorily even post retirement, with sufficient amount of funds to sustain and lead a healthy life. Thus, steps actively taken by the governments along with rising awareness regarding health and diseases by various media has helped people lead healthy lives.",6
"In 2015, it is common to hear a story on the news of a person living well past 100 years. These used to be extreme cases many years ago, but they have become regular occurrences. There are several contributing factors to this phenomenon, including technological advancements, increased awareness, and increased access to resources. Technology is a major contrinbuting factor to people living longer lives. The advancements in medicine is quite astonishing compared to 100 years ago. Physicians have many resources at their fingertips to help diagnose and treat patients suffering from a variety of medical conditions. Whether it be a chronic condition such as diabetes or a more serious condition such as cancer, there are more treatments available that help heal people quicker and help them manage normal lives. Additionally, medicine to help maintain chronic conditions have become very affordable for people to purchase. Lastly, there is a much larger focus on preventative care and medicine to help diagnose issues early on so that physicians can treat these conditions earlier. Patients are strongly encouraged to participate in preventative screenings to identify any issues and move forward with treatment if necessary to help them live a longer and healthier life. In addition to technology being a driving force behind people living longer, people also have more awareness and access to resources to better their life. There are television networks, magazines, websites, and even mobile apps dedicated to living a healthier life. These resources showcase healthy lifestyle tips including exercise plans, meal plans, and even healthy sleep habits. With all of this information at people's fingertips, it is easy for them to learn what they need to do to maintain a healthy lifestyle and live longer. With access to all of these resources, people are living longer, healthier lives.",6
"At the present world,people tend to live longer it is beacuse of the precautions and the basic facilities available at the present world economy.The new medical facilities have ensured that people would be prevented from diseases being evolved due to the pollution and unhygenic society.New medical facilities such as vaccines,poliyo drops,cancer prevention tablets,pre-injection for diseases have be included in day-to-day peoples life.These vaccines and pre-injections should be manditorly taken atleast once in two months in order to prevent the forth coming illness.The economy has been highered where most of the people are well educated and well settled,they tend to have all the facilities in order to stay healthy and strong enough to face anything and anywhere.the food what we get now are not much hygenic,people get attacked beacause of letting them go to have road side foods and soon thet get affected.Once they are attacked with some disease they fall a sick and they move to the best doctors in town and get themselves checked and get injected and are prevented. Due to the best hospitality facilities,people are being cured easily because we have got the best doctors all over the world,who has undergone differnt researches in finding out the best medicines inorder for the better curing of the diseases.The cancer is being very common and is being evolved very easily even to the small kids and teenagers.the prevention to these cancer diseases have created a revolution and it is easy go process or operation being performed to cure the cancer out of oneselves.The best medicines have be found for curing of cancer diseases in the abroad countries.It is manditory that the new born kids are given vaccines once in two months or once in six months in order to the kid to stay healty and longer and disease free.Thus only by taking up these vaccinies and poliyo drops dosent mean one can stay healthy and happy,it does matters oh how he brings himself out being happy and stressless.the more he/she is stressed up the more the amount he/she is goin to be affected.Thus a person who remains happy and healthy and concious of what happening to their health and those who take much more care about themselves live longer and happier.",5
"United Nation developed a concept of quantifying Human Development Index using three basic parameters, average life expectancy being one of them. Development of any nation does not only depends on per capita income but actually on standard of living of its residents and this has formed the basis of development of HDI. An average increase in life expectancy years can be seen through records and there have been multiple changes in the society which support this increase. 1. Recent researches show that population below poverty line in India has been reduced to about 12% only which was more than 30% some decades ago. Spending power has increased and hence people utilise this increase in resources to maintain their well-being. 2. Globalisation has allowed MNC's to setup their offices across borders & as per international policies, companies also provide health cover to employees and their family members. This is also an important factor as formal systems have been established which make accessiblity to medical services easier. 3. Government has also taken commendable steps to improve the situation. Government Dispenceries have been opened on large scale which provide better health facilities to poor at affordable costs in just a few kilometers reach. 4. Government also provides health services to its employees as well. Large number of families across India get direct benefit from such policies which eventually increase in nhigher life expactancy. 5. Better educational standards have created better doctors and better researches have generated better medicines to cure dreadful diseases like cancer. Initially there was a huge problem of access to good doctors & medicines. 6. Reach of media through every form has increased exponentially in past decades. This eventually means that now awareness programs reach more people and more people use this knowledge to take care of their health.",5
"TODAYS ERA IS THE ERA OF TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENTS. IN EARLIER DAYS DUE TO LACK OF TECHNOLOGY THERE WERE NOT MANY DEVELOPMENTS IN THE FIELD OF HEALTH CARE AND MEDICINES. BUT WITH THE DEVELOPMENTS IN FIELD OF SCIENCE AND MORE TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENTS MORE AND MORE MEDICINES, TREATMENTS RELATED TO VARIOUS DISEASES, EQUIPMENTS AND MACHINES NEEDED FOR THE THESE TREATMENTS HAVE CAME INTO SCENE. NOWADAYS THE HOSPITALS, BE IT BE PUBLIC, PRIVATE OR GOVERNMENTAL, ARE WELL EQUIPED WITH THESE MACHINES. ALSO DUE TO ADVANCEMENTS IN THE FIELD OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION SYSTEM HAS IMPROVED TO A GREATER EXTEND PRODUCING MORE EFFICIENT DOCTORS AND OTHER PERSONNELS RELATED TO THE FIELD OF HEALTHCARE AND MEDICINES. ALSO MEDICINES LIKE THE GENERIC MEDICINES (MEDICINES IN THE THEIR GENERIC CORE FORM) HAS COME INTO ROLE. THE COST OF THESE GENERIC MEDICINES ARE QUITE LOW THAN THE MEDICINES SOLD IN THE MARKET. MOREOVER THE GOVERNMENT HASE BECOME SENSITIVE TOWARDS THE ISSUE OF HEALTHCARE, AS THE DISEASES ARE INCREASING DAY BY DAY AND NEW DISEASES ARE COMING INTO PREVELANCE. FOR QUALITY MEDICAL EDUCATION MANY WELL REPUTED MEDICAL COLLEGES ARE BEING OPENED THROUGHOUT THE GLOBE. ALSO FOR PROVIDING QUALITY TREATMENT TO THE PATIENTS MANY EFFICIENT HOSPITALS AND HEALTHCARE CENTRES ARE BEING BROUGHT INTO RUNNING STAGE.

"""In general people are living longer now"" is a very true fact. Living longer has been made possible largely due to the advancement of technology, awareness among people, better infrastructure being provided by the governments , ease of accessibility to medi-care , increasing awareness and campaigns on health and hygiene. The reasons stated above are the broad reasons catering to increasing life span of people of all economies - developed , developing and also underdeveloped. The developed economies of the world are already advance and aware and are continuosly working for the betterment of the its citizens. Firstly , it has been made possible due to the large amount of funds available at the disposal of such developed economies. In collaboration with huge resources and efficient governance , the developed economies are continuosly investing in research programs. With the advancement in techonology and of medical science various vaccines have been produced which have been successfull in eradicating deadly dieases like small pox from all over the globe. Further , with the unrelenting efforts of the UN organisation - WHO these vaccines have been made available even to the remote areas so that the dieases can be successfully eradicated. Secondly , as compared to earlier times , people have become more aware about their well-being and so they too take initiative in maintaining their health. Thirdly , governments are now taking adequate steps to provide better sanitation facilities to the people which has helped in preventing people from contracting dieses like malaria , diarreohea , typhoid , fever etc. The Swatch Bharat Abhiyaan initiated by the Modi government is in furtherance of this cause. There are many other reasons which have led to increase in the life span of people and government's efforts in this cause can not be over shadowed.",5
"With the fast paced growth of technology in the recent years, there has been a hand in hand increase in innovations. These new discoveries or innovations have taken place in many industries, of which the health and pharmaceutical industries has seen a high level of growth. With this fast paced growth and innovation, the world has seen the discoveriy of new drugs and medical discoveries to cure the many diseaseas that had once redered us helpless in the past. There has also been an increased interest in health and wellness programs in the recent years. Individuals of all ages have begun to place increased importance in their personal health and wellness. A rise in awareness and interest has been seen in the recent years, in health and wellness programs such as yoga, ayurveda, accupuncture and various meditation programs, as seen in the recent celebration of world yoga day. Organisations also promote health and wellness through provisions of various benefits and workshops such as medical allowance, insurance, etc. Organisations have also been seen to recognise the importance of mental health in the recent years.They have begun to introduce counsellors, trained coaches, employee assistance programs, etc to help assist their employees needs in a holistic manner. Through these various programs hosted and other benefits offered to individuals by various insititutions to promote health and wellness right from the educational level and continues even after retirement. Gone are the days when employees were used for their services and rewarded only with monetary benefits. Hence people are seen to live longer now since, more focus has been given to them as humans rather than machines. The human aspect is being given more importance and organisations are using this human aspect as an essential resource tied to their success.",5
"REASONS FOR INCREASE IN LIFE EXPECTANCY: INTRODUCTION: It can be very well inferred from the census that the average life expectancy of people has drastically increased. It has become common to see people with age more than 80 years. Lets discuss some of the major reasons for this improvement. GOOD MEDICAL FACILITIES: The field of medical science has shown a major revolution. Nowadays there are medicines for almost all the diseases. For the diseases that cannot be cured using medicines, there are several surgical methods. Medical Engineering helps in the manufacture of precise surgical equipments. In some surgeries, robots that make use of artificial intelligence has proved to work successfully with greater accuracy in operation than human surgeons. OTHER REASONS: Apart from good medical facilities, there are few other reasons that play a major role in improving the life expectancy of human beings. (i) Food: Earlier days people used to eat food directly from the sources like plants or animals. Nowadays food is processed before consumption. Milk is pasteurized to remove bacteria. Sugar and salt are purified to get clear crystals. Likewise all the food items and water are properly purified to make it free of micro organisms like virus or bacteria. (ii) Neat and clean environment: The environment that we live in is sanitized well by the government. The government also takes efforts to reduce the mosquitoes by spraying chemicals and closing the drainages. Mosquitoes are parasites that are mainly responsible for several diseases like Malaria, Dengue, Cholera, Typhoid, some of which are deadly. CONCLUSION: Thus it can be inferred that the life expectancy of people could be increased day by day with development in technology and cooperation of people in making the environment a cleaner and safer place to live in.",5
"'In general, people are living longer now', this phrase directly implises that the average age of the people now has increased. The statistics and the government recods supports this fact. the average age, life expectancy etc. has increased considrably. This is a result of the ever developing medical science and public awareness of the different health hazards. In the past few years, medical science has developed exponentially. New cures and medications are being invented everyday. Dieseases which were considered incureable are now being cured even at every local dispensery. Diseases like Polio, Hepietitus A, Hepetitus B etc. are now being cured by giving vaccinations and medications to young infants and children so that there is no chance in the future for any mishappening. Even chronic diseases like Cancer, AIDS, TB etc. are being cured at some level to save millions of life. In old days the medicals science was not that developed, people died of dmall diseases because they did not received proper medical attention.Hospitals were far and few, doctors were not available readily. This led to millions of deaths at young ages. The other reasons behind the increased life of people now a days is the public awareness and proper diet taken by people. People are now aware of many health hazards, they visit docotrs regularly and try keep their bodies healty by various exercises, yoga, meditation etc. Children get proper nutritional diets which helps their growth and development. But on the other hand, the phrase also has a contradictory nature, people now a days are indulged more in unhealthy lifestyles. Smoking, alcohal, junk food has become a part of life which is leading to various life threatemimg diseases like cancer, dibeties, obesity etc. This unhealty lifestyle is adding to the deaths of millions.",5
"We have entered 21 st century which is marked by rapid developments and discoveries in medical field along with an emerging holistic approach towards life.Many diseases have been completely irradicated and various vaccines have been introduced.People are more aware of their lifestyles and eating habits.Gyms,Spas,Health clubs and medical insurance are on roll.This indicates the awareness and mindfulness of people towards living better and longer.The average life expectancy at birth has improved immensely compared to decades back.Today we have a cure for most fatal diseases which has striked out a great probability of loss of life.Unlike earlier times,say at the begining of 21 st century and before the medical arenas were not as developed, neither was there good connectivity of roads and communication services.People died in masses in case of a wide spread epidemic.Conditions have gone a sea change since then.Also people have started living life with a healthier and happier approach.Importance of human life is immense.More and more people have come in terms of this fact and there has been a psychological modifications in most people.People today are more conscious of their habits and lifestyles and work willingly to improve their life expectancy.Another factor has been safe and secure housing.When our ancestors resided in forest,they dealt with the constant risk of being attaked by other wild animals.There was an ever continuing competition with other life forms.Only the fittest survived.But the civilization of human has improved the situation and decreased the tussle for life. All the drastic and applausable advancements in medical fields have been a boon for mankind.Besides this,the general awarness amongst people about their lifestyles,safety,health hazards have contributed towards a longer life.",5
"When you observe in an overall basis , people live longer now not because there are no problems or diseases but because the technology has increased this much that every problem has its solution. Firstly , if we bring into our notice during olden days people were hardly concerned about their life , they just wanted to live for the sake of living because that time the generation was different , they had no aim and no reasons to live . But when we look on the overall basis today everyone has their opinion, their way of living and no one wants to just die rather achieve something and live longer. it was always said that good health always leads you to a good path. before it was difficult for the prople to undersatand but now even from a child till the old people , everyone has realised the importance of good health and the purpose living No one can predict that for how many years someone's going to live but a person can surely increase his life span by having a good health, maintaing his pysique , and having a happy life . resons of living longer is just a simple thing be happy always , reduce stress and for reducing stress best solution is doing excercise regularly ( yoga ) . since people are living longer automatically they get into the fact that yes they have to do something in their life. today their is no age limit for anything. old people who couldnt study in their age are completing their degrees in various forms. and they realise that how much is life important to them. its all about human tendency to begin and proceed in their life in which way. The other reason which can be is reduction in intake of tabacco and alchol . though people intake it but they know their limits and in addition todays technology is reaching the hieghts there is no problem which cannot be cured. The causes of this phenomenon is that as people are living longer the values cultures beliefs etc is still existing in this world. because when you compare a joint family will be more discipline and decent compared to nuclear family .LIVING LONGER is just the matter of thinking. its all about how you live your life , in which way and when you die you know that you have achieved something in your life.",4
"Everyone love their loved ones and no body wants to leave them before thier natural death at a very long age. As our eating habnits and busy schedule is there we don't get time to exercise to do manual work and this the nunmber of problems that the human body is facing is getting more but the advancement in technology has reduced the risk to death at an early age due to any problem. In this modern era we are very advance in development in all the fields. The medical lines are also doing their best now days we are getting cure to the every diesease we are getting . Our societey is increasing at a wide range with all the developments made by us are getting us to the situation that we can live longer.Scientists are undergoing thousands of searches in labs so that we can get cures to all the dieseases. We have developed some of the vaccinations also that our body gets immune from the diesease before it is occured. In older times one cant even survive if he or she gets the simple fever but now even have the cure to the fever before it occurs. Thousands of new technological machienes are developed to monitor every simgle part of the human body for the diagnosis. Moreover the transplanting techniques which have been developed have added to the survival rates. One can now even transplant heart, liver, lungs, kidneys,eyebalss etc. mostly every part of the human body can be transplanted for regenuvated. Not only this our doctors have made their name in the surgical section many surgeries that were undergone throught the big procedure of all cuts and stiches is now reduced tu just a simple mark on the body and it is done this lasic treatment has also increased the patients survival rate and the rate of infection is also decreased by this techniques. Now concluding that the increase in age is just because of our advancement in medical fields all the cures to all the dieseases some like cancers has also been there and it is good step in the advancement of the society and afcorse no one wants to leave their loved ones at any cost neither anyone wants to be away from their loved ones. This technique has increased very much and this is very good for the human beings.",4

There is an other statement which tells that clapping helps a person to stay fit and it keeps one's mind calm and relaxed so it is better to clap daily for atleast 20 minutes which tunes up our mind so that we can do any work with enthusiasm and with full confidence. We have to advice our children to clap daily which will make their handwriting good and helps them to be active always.

"people are living longer nowdays because of their awareness. Nowdays we have number of source of ideas by doing which we can live long. Everyone wants to enjoy the life, and we can enjoy it till the last day of our life. So if we have long life then we have more days to live to enjoy. There are many causes like some people like money,for which they will spend there whole life to earn it. They think they will earn money like that and will enjoy later.Medical science is developed very well and we have treatment for most of the health problems. However nowdays pollution is increasing day by day and all we can do is to find solution at early stage. People are doing Yoga which is one of the best way to keep your self healthy. Nowdays we can easily consult with docotor or anyone about our health problems and according to which we make our diet by which you can live healthy life. However dur to lack of foods, lack of money for medical issues many people lives are not so long. But if we care for our health and if we eat healthy food if we do exercise and Yoga and if we take care of everything related to our health we can also live long despite of such polluted environment. Now we have technology, we have everthing which can help us to live long. The only things we need to do is give proper attention to such things. We can make proper time table for such thing, however many people are not in the favour of doing such things. And people who gives proper attention will live long life.

Which environment is suitable and what not has increased that is helping the people to take care about theri health and makes them live longer..Even in village areas , large organsiations conduct health wealth and education related awareness programs to make villagers aware of how to upgrade themselves and what to do in some critical situations. this has helped to inculcate the feeling of how to lead a longer life among the uneducated people too. inspite of all the faciliities and awarenes progrmas conducted by the government and various organsiations death rate is not decreasing upto the desried extent ,.This is beacause of adaptaing wrong habits like smoking ,liquor, and use of narcotic drugs. government should take strict actions against this habit to improve the nation",4
"""People are living longer now"" is pretty much a true statement and the reason behind this is the advancement in the field of Medical Science. The world has developed at a good pace with development of technologies and researches in various field of science. The contribution made in the field of medical science in the techonological aspect is comendable. The chance of survival from a severe disease has drastically increased as of researchers can experimentally test the success rate of cure for any disease using the tech aspects designed for the same. Few examples are: the Laser treatment for skin, kidney stones etc., MRI scans for fast detection of internal damage etc. Even in the field of Medical drugs production, the discovery of new elements and the stabilty of many compounds to produce effective medicines can now be well tested using experimental environment. The Medical Science has now got more medicinal cure which is safe and easy to go through rather than going through the tedious, expensive and painful operations. Such medicainal cure are affordable and any class of people can afford it. Apart from these aspects the Government has also taken many initiative to erradicate diseases which can be avoided at a much previous stage by spreading awareness and organising health camps. Hence the newly borns can be made safe from such diseases. WHO(World Health Organisation) is the major body that looks into this matter. It creates statistical report every year to rate the countries in terms of health and death rate. It also enforces countries under its guidance to take necessary step to avoid any major mishap. No medical way of keeping onself fit is also encouraged by WHO. By the awareness drives,yoga and exercise Ona whole the people are much safer now in comparison to the earlier time when such medical advancements were not present. The chances of living a fresh and healthy life are much greater now. Fitness is",4
"The statement given above is highly agreed upon. In a general view, we do see alot of people living longer as compared to their older generation counterparts. In the recent years, there is no denial to the fact that people have become more concerned about their health and fitness. The living standard of the people has considerably enhanced all around the world in the recent era. Every individual seeks to make his life better in every way possible due to which we have also observed a growing market for organic and healthy food, fitness centres,yoga classes, etc. Slowly and staedily people have accepted these activities into their daily normal lifesytyle and the benefits are being surely reaped. The Life- expectancy ratio has considerably enhanced over the years in various countries because of the adoption of a more organized lifestyle. Other point worth noting to support the statement and underline the reason is that a lot of countries which were plagued by poverty, lower standard of living and unhygienic contditions have been slowly moving on a developing path wherein conditions have become a lot better as compared to the 20 years past. Steps taken by developing countries such as India in the recent times to develop the nation and the interests of the people therein, in the form of providing better living conditions, hygiene care and reduction of poverty has indirectly increased the life- expectancy rate in India. Similarly, such enhanced living conditions have definitely led topeople living healthier and longer. A famous personality once said,""A healthy heart and a healthy mind are the paths to success"". Definitely, a good state of your body and mind rejuvenates the mechanism of the functioning of the body leading you to a longer life. A developing concern by the people, attempts by the countries and adoption of a healhy lifestyle and a few of the resons we see people living longer now.",4
"LIFE IS WHAT WE LIVE. LIFE IS WHAT WE MAKE OUT OF IT. quality of life lead by a person determines his longevity of life. In today's fast paced life, everybody has their own set of goals and objectives to be met in their life but in common everybody wants to live a long healthy hazzle free life. this is again because everybody cherishes a standard living life and want to extent it more.. for this everybody becomes HEALTH CONSCIOUS. people try to stay fit. most of them do involve in physical activity such as gym, walking, exercises and yoga. people do meditation to stay calm and composed all through the day. apart from all this most of them do dieting to stay fit. A healthy diet would make you fit and feel fresh all through the day.. these being the activities done by most of them to live long. other than these attributes MODERNISED MEDICAL FACILITY is available to most of them in source with medical policies, medical insurance and medical coverages from corporates for whom people work. apart from this, there is a growing awareness about leading a healthy life and how it is possible so by this people are genuinely involved in activities that would endure your life. many others want to live long so as to make their children happy living. people work for long years to make money and to build wealth for future generations, so they are crazed to live long. they adhere to regular medical check ups and other medications to live long. people after retirement wants to happily spend life and they want to live long and cherish the life that is given by the nature. even aged old people has a desire to live long. they undertake all possible measures and medications to let live long. More than anything the DESIRE to live long makes people to go on in search for better living and long life. with economy improved everybody gets improved. with this the average life of a person tends to improve.",4
"""In general,people are living longer now."" The simple reason behind this fact or phenomena is that now-a-days people are more concerned about their health and diet.They are even too cautious about their lives and the development in the science and technology had lead to the inventions of various treatments in the fields of medical science,which is just like a boon for people suffering from several diseases and gets recovered by these mazical treatments.This advancement in the medical science has been like a god's miracle,which can give the life to the patients once again.Besides,there are several people doing various exercises and joined various gyms ,in order to maintain good health.As people are very concious about their health, many yoga camps has been organized.The most surprising and great thing for our nation is that our prime minister Mr. Narendra Modi has promoted and organized for the ""World Yoga Diwas"" for the first time in the history,this really shows how much we all are concerned about our lives and health.I have also seen the craze of the body fitness and health improvement plans among youngsters.There are several number of people who control over their diet and eat only healthy things in order to make sure ,that whatever they eat should not harm to their health and this is what the leading phenomena towards the cause of people living longer these days.In ancient times ,people do not had any advanced science and technology in medical science and people were not so concious about their health and diets, they were just like used to eat whatever they wished, they never concern about the adverse effect of those in their health and there were not much number of hospitals for them to get treated for their health issues, and this fact had lead to their short lives,but now as there is advancement in everything,thus people are living longer now a days.",4
"Improved access to healthcare has risen the number of years we live The advancements in technology in the fiel of medicine has not just benefited the rich and the affluent, but it also has trickled down to developing nations. One of the reasons this has happened is because of the availability of generic medicines. Indian pharmaceutical companies have played a major role in improving the access to medicines by manufacturing life saving drugs such as ARTs for HIV patients and cancer drugs at a fraction of the cost of the same drugs manufactured in the West. Even global health institutions such as the World Health Organisation (WHO) distributes generic good quality medicines in developing nations such as African countries, India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh which have been plagued by AIDS, multi-drug resistent TB and other chronic illnesses. Better access to medicines has helped raise life expectancy. In addition to improved access, the WHO is working with governments throughout the world to develop health programmes with an aim to make healthcare facilities available to the poor. They work in tandem with local non-profits, NGOs, village and local governments to implement national health policies and encourage a positive and scientific attitude towards health. This has had a positive impact on the health of people in various age groups and has resulted in reducing child mortality rates, therefore extending the number of years people live. Also, national health programmes such as Obamacare in the United States, the universal healthcare programme in United Kingdom and a more indigenous example and the DOTS tuberculosis control programme have helped improved access to healthcare by providing cheap and free healthcare facilities to every member of the society, regardless of his or her income. This, in turn, has helped people live longer, healthier lives.",4
"Time is constantly changing and we are moving towards a more advanced and developed environment. We have solutions to every problem and we are able to overcome our problems within minutes and sometimes, we are able to obtain expert solutions to our problems with ease. This development over time is the main reason for the changes we incur now in comparison to the olden days. The main reasons for this development is the awareness which has built up among the people, the desire to grow, technology and digitalisation, acceptance to fast changing environment, need for faster and competent solutions. In olden days, while there was absolutely no technology or awarness, people inculcated natural means of curing diseases and finding solutions to their problems. These solutions by our ancestors are even now in use and are the best solutions too. The drawback these natural solutions had is that they were not swift in their approach and did not have the right specific impact. Improper medical facilities, no communication, no clear awareness about sexual health, unwillingness to adopt themselves to better facilities, no proper knowledge, all these led to smaller life spans of people despite the fact of having healthier lifestyles than the current generation. The current generation has got everything in their fingertips. Technology has blanketed every portion - healthcare, communication, lifestyle, education, etc. People present in all niches are made aware of the different diseases and problems that are prevailing and the solutions are also right before them through the most easily accessible manner. Solutions are there for even the deadliest of them can be cured with the proper guidance and the latest tools. Our entire lives are digitalised, and these remain the solution too for the ill effects occuring because of them. We control our life spans too!",4
"Yes I aggree with people living longer now. Nowadays, technology took a tremondous leap from the previous couple of decades and it made the great development in the various areas like medical, enggineering, industrial etc. As the medical innovations took place, we have cured lots of diseases that couldn't be cured previous days like cancers, polio, rabis, small pox etc where people died alot. This medical innovations made the people to cure near death deaseases also. People stated to think in the environmental way where their health as well as the environmental health teaks great turn. They started participating actively in the health awareness programs and in certains activities like gym, yoga, excercise and physical development therapies for physical wellness. For mental wellness they started doing meditation, laughing therapies etc. This is at one end On the other half technology made them to live shorter too. Technology made people to think big live big and act big. In this very sense they started trying vehicles which increased traffic, music beyond limits which made noise pollution, and foremore due to the lack of family relationships, value towards humans decreased which made people to lose humanity and stated encouraging terrorism like mass killing activities. These make the killing more even though people had chance to live longer these case make them live short and sadly unexpected deaths. People are living longer, but they can live more longer if they can take control on the environment, human relationships, technology, personal health ehich will make one to survive peacefully both inner as well as outer. This not only benifits the individual but also the nation which they belong as a part of human resources and the development as they contribue themselves enormously in all the aspects moreover PEOPLE ARE THE NATION themselves.",4
"People live longer now for several reasons. Technological advancement in dealing with illnesses is one. It improves quality of living by engaging sick patients in their course of recovery. Advertisments as well are rampant in all sorts of media that educate people on how to live a healthy lifestyle. Medication for certain illnesses are also highly available in the market that allows consumers to buy prescribed medicine for their condition. Doctors, nurses and other health providers as well are being collaborative with each one, that paves way for the team to monitor disease progress or healing in a faster manner. Machines that are being used in the hospital as well are well-equipped and maintained to offer high-end service for patients seeking for hospital admission. The sanitation is also deemed with much importance in the hospital so as not to aggravate the condition of sick patients. In addition to that, microorganims are being minimized by continuously abiding to hospital sanitation and policy. Hence by accessible hospitals, available cure such as medication to certain illnesses, skilled health professionals and medical apparatus and continued researches on how to deal with life-threatening conditions, have served their purpose in prolonging lives of people. As such, those factors evidently have helped people who has terminal illness cope up with the best that they can with the available options provided for them. Although healing takes time, it also needs spiritual intervention to get ourselves be attached to reality that nothing on Earth is constant, and even our lives are just temporary and that doesn't exempt us, human beings. Human as we are, we are entitled to face death. And as living creatures, it all boils down on how responsible we are in making choices. From the food we intake to the lifestyle we chose to prolong our life.",4
"The scientific and technological advancement has influenced the life span of people. According to the recent surveys, people, nowadays are living longer than earlier. At earlier times, medical science and medicines were not sufficient to cure diseases and people demised due to extreme sufferings and pain. But in 21st century, the entire scenario is completely different. Medical science has come up with solutions to cure deadly diseases like small pox, plague, cholera, cancer, Tuberculosis and the list is endless. A huge credit goes to 'Biotechnology', the branch of science which deals with biological technology and advancement. Engineerings from bio-medical fields have come up with new instruments and technology which made detecting cancer easier. It is the pride of science, that nowadays, a deadly disease like cancer is curable. Apart from technological advancement, social life and environment also play equal role to enhance Human life span. Compared to old times, when people were not aware of proper cleanliness, diseases and infections were common but nowadays, people take special care of cleanliness and hygienes. Roads and drains are cleaned in every due time. Special departments are being made in every area who take care of cleanliness and hygienes.Hence the common infections and diseases which demised people earlier are now no more a matter of concern. Individuals themselves have become aware of their health. On addition, Indian Government has itself taken initiatives named ""Swaach Bharat Abhiyan"" which is helping India to become cleaner and better place to live in. However, technology and cleanliness are not the only reasons which have enhanced people's life span. A very important point to be noted in this context, is the rising popularity of yoga and fitness which has successfully increased the life span of an indivisual.",4
"People are living longer now. Yes, as compared to two decades back, we lacked medical expertise, innovative treatment and safety measures. The growth of medical industry, technological advancements etc have led to the enhancement and betterment of the health conditions of the patients. The various prime issues of health were cancer, AIDS and such. But, now things have changed drastically. There are medications done for cancer by which a patient can survive. As compared to decades back, people died due to cancer becuase there was no medication for it. But, now due to the technological advancement and researchs done by the scientists has helped in saving many lives. The other reason is education. Back in 80's people hardly knew about safety measures and they dint knew about how they could resist a heartattack or cardiac arrest. But now people are aware of the safety and precautionary measures that can be taken during mishaps. Also, the growth in the service sector has led to better health facilities. 24*7 Ambulance service and innovative hygiene techniques are some. The rise in the economy and earning capacity has also increased the rise in the health conditions of the people. People in early 80's weren't educated and couldn't afford bills. People nowadays can afford medical treatment in abroad too. The promotions of the health industries have educated the people to adopt hygiene techniques and to control the risk of getting infected. The various ads on TV also help in preventing diseases such as saffola oil decreasing the risk of heartattack, Dettol handwash decreasing the risk of infection through virus and bacteria and lifeboy. Hence, with all such facts we can conclude that people are living longer now due the above stated changes in the health industries and also with the growth of the service sectors.",4
"With the recent advancements in medical sciences and technology, one cannot agree more about the increment in the life span of human beings. Various causes, explanations and theories have been widely discussed in this context. Firstly, hospitals and health care centers spread across the globe have had a huge impact on the life span of people. With health advice and medicines accessible for all and that too within one or two mile radius from their localities, people have understood the age old wisdom of ""prevention is better than cure"". Also, with high levels of technological advancements and higher amounts of research to eliminate deadly bacteria and virus, one can safely assume the life span of an average human being will increase two-fold. Thirdly, the point to be noted is the present day awareness surrounding the world population. hundred years back, people wouldn't have had an ounce of knowledge about a common cold or an influenze symptom. Today, even a five year old kid can name the virus responsible AIDS. Understanding the causes of development is complex and very discreet at the same time. Vaccines were developed understanding the effect of the bacteria on animals. As rightly said by many, ""necessity is the mother of all inventions"". With the necessity to eliminate and eradicate deadly diseases, scientists all around the world have worked and are continuously working to make the world a better and healthy place to live in. In this process, immunization to various bacteria has helped man indirectly to live a long and also a health life. Also, Education can be cited as an important cause of this phenomenon. Education has imbibed people with the required amount of awareness about symptoms of various diseases and this has eventually lead to people preferrring a ""precaution over cure"" lifestyle.",4
"Today, the world is mainly revolving around the several technological developments.Even though the dark side of it talks about the several lifestyle disorders,it has mainly contributed to curbing of deadly diseases.Taking the predominant advances made in the field of medicine,it very much becomes evident that the number of successful birth rates have increased .This is a clear indication that people are aware of the techniques and medication that is normally available to prevent such poor deaths. The research field is growing at a fast pace and our BRIGHT MINDS ,the scientists are working day and night ,studying the health patterns of people across the globe,analysing the data obtained,which thereby ,provides them a clear picture to decide whether to develop preventive medication or not.APart from the medication field,several high end equipments have been introduced , that provides us a clear picture to study about the human body in detail and identify the causes and also preventive measures.One best example that can be cited for the above statement is that of famous hollywood actress Angelina Jolie,who had her breasts removed ,when she learnt that she had the genetic strains of breast cancer causing organism.She is now able to live a peaceful life with an extended lifetime. Adding on to these medical revolutions,the government of the respective countries are ensuring that they are accessible by any common man.Human resource form the engine for the economic growth of the country.Thus several laws and bills are being passed by the government to provide healthcare facilities,or as incentives to regulate human health.The World Health Organisation , which is the centre for ensuring world health ,regulates the activities of its member countries through treaties framed during their regular conventions.",4

Finally,if we want to live longer than we have to do -daily excercise,yoga,have to go for checkups and properly treatment in hospitals,avoid eating junk foods and go for a daily walk.",3
"I disagree to the fact that people live longer now. Unlikely in the earlier days, we get to see men and women live less longer in modern world. Earlier, the life expectancy ranged to 70-80 years but now it has come down to less than 50 years. The amount of diseases and iniquities has go up the ozone level that each day we see people die of cancer, tumor, cardiac arrests and so on. it was just yesterday i was been told to pray for one uncle of mine who was affected with a disease which the hospital officials could not even diagonise the fatal disease. The list does not end there. It goes on and on. The causes due to such early dismissal in life is mainly because of the food intake by the people. The amount of junk food, instant feeding systems, burgers with extra cheese and fries contributes to the above. We see even village dhabas have upgraded to another level but the food which they provide is not much of hygiene and declined sanitary working conditions. also pollution in terms of air, water, soil has gone up to another level where people inhale polluted air and water leading them to chronic water infections, respiratory ailments etc. Also, the people consuming the amount of smoke and alcohol has increased over the years. this leads to major lung disease, cardiac arrest, kidney failures and the list can be expanded. i do not see that people live longer now than the olden times. But the fact that lots of new medicines and curies is being developed every day. Lots of medical experiments as well trial outs make people live longer. Cancer centers and home care treatment which give special care to the patients make it cancer a much curable disease now. Thanks to technology and the brilliant minds of the doctors and researchers all over the world. Initiatives and measures can be taken to prevent the intake of beer. Awareness programs, restrictive use of alcohol can be framed and implemented successfully. I and you can be contribute a lot in making the world a better place to live . Maybe put in hands to make our environment go green, preserve our mother land and son on.",3

"As we all know,that our country INDIA ,is a vast place to live and it is the amalgamation of different people with different thoughts and mentality,people with different cultures ,traditions and customs.There are also people following different religions,castes and dialects.If we roll back the pages of our history,we will see how we have been living in this diverse country.We should also salute the scientists and all those renowned people who have brought great technology and advancement for the country.If we talk about medical science,it has flourished a lot in the past decades.Earlier,people used to die even due to small illness ,but today medical science has a remedy for every disease.There were times when people were dying because of cancer,tumers and so on,but today our government has constructed seperate hospitals for those patients suffereing from these fatal diseases.Also , we should not forget about the cleanliness that is maintained in the environment which is ultimately affecting our health.If the surrounding in ehich we are living is clean,then we are definately living a peaceful and happy life.Also,the lifespan of the people are also increased.The more we keep our environment clean,we will live a more happier and longer life.We should also show gratitude towards our government that organises training and awareness programmes for every indivisuals on how to live a peaceful and healthy life.The people are given training sessions for doing yoga,morning exercises or morning walk,taking healthy diet and avoid junk and oily food.If we are practising these exercises every morning,it would do a lot of benefit to us and keep us away from all diseasesast but not the least,the advertisements that our shown in the televisions are a major source of promotions from where we can also indulge ourselves in the practise of doing exercises.These are are the areas from where we can get alot of inspiration.So,we can rightly say that that people are living longer now.",3
"""Life is a beautiful gift by god"". In this present scenario, we can see many people living in an average of 75 years. This shows that something has been changed from earlier days for which people are living a life span more than people used to live in earlier days. Nowadays advancement in technologies may lead to this kind of transformation. We can get anything in internet to know how to live fit and healthy, what we should avoid diseases, what to eat and what not to. People are becoming concious day by day for their healthy life. We can see many people performimg yoga on daily basis, taking healthy diet, maintaining a proper routine for their food and gym. As a result of which people are living a longer life. Earlier days not all people were aware of the healthy facts. They knew food is important to life but in present generation we know which food is important to life and how much food is required to maintain perfect body and keeping oneself healthy. Earlier people used to do hard work and thought that is enough for keeping themselves fit. But the truth is not the same. Moreover we have got many devices nowadays like android watch which tells us about the health status like heartbeat rate, how obese are we ,and many more, for which we are becoming concious and maintaining our health accordingly. Apart from all this , nowadays medical science is improving day by day, disease like cancer also have treatment in present day. According to The Times of India one man is still living with a life span of 120 years, one cannot imagine by seeing him that he is actually of that age. He seems to be like 70 years old person. For the first time in his life span he went to hospital for blood pressure. When asked about his secret he performed yoga in the hospital and everyone wer shocked seeing that. So take adavantage of the present development in science and live healthy. Avoid smoking cigarretes and other addictive drugs to live alonger life span.",3
"People are living longer is a true statement which is possible ,majorly due to new inventions and breathtaking technology in the health sector.The improvement of the health sector was boosted by the industrial revolution in the 19th centuary.Pharmaceutical companies are earning huge amounts of revenue for the single reason there is cure for almost every disease and ailment.Indian companies such as Sun Pharma have been top earners of revenue in the Indian business scenario.The path breaking eradication of small pox,reduction in the cases of polio attacks by introducing polio drops to children,effective administration of insulin to diabetes,introduction of various vaccines for babies such as protection from various viral diseases,antivenom invention to treat snake bites and various other inventions and improvement in the health sectorhave been an impetus for people to live longer.There have also been an increase of health personnel like doctors,nurses,surgeons etc who are actually trained in various fields such orthopaedist,gynaecology,heart surgeons etc who are provinding quality services to the people Science has further grown not only has health sector been improved but also the supporting sectors have also improved such as infrastructure,transportation, communication and many other sectors which has actually improved the standard of living .People earn more than compared during last 100 years and all services are available to everyone .

"nowadays people are getting more stronger and younger as well compared with there healthg and their surrounding they are preferebly liking to be at peace and nice time which makes them healthier and stronger as well.basically a person should be confident about themselves and not really scared about their health unnecessarily which makes people more depressed and not to enjoy their life thimking about it.then we also have much more helath organisation places to very well look after the old people and many medical health care are also been started giving treatment in any critical situation like for example people nowadays jus feel ""cancer"" like some normal nfever or something jus because they are totally ready to spend money on any basis specifically for anyones health .people are mor likely to live longer nowadays by enjoying with there grand children which makes them forget oneself and live there own life .but as in the major thing is thge medical invents newly as been brought into the process were it is like if a person is ready to pay howmuch ever the bill is the helath is been cured and the person is saved. that is the major idea of the hospitals nowadays which automatically make the normal people to make live longer and much more sometimes.we have frequent treatments been given to the person who is not well and makes his or her life cycle extend.this also says that not only the medical organisation make people stronger or something but also ones own life being happier anf finding peace within themselves without getting into any crap which eventually makes people peacefully live their life and needed care sometimes.for example if we take ""cancer"" doctors says that the person has like 6 months time and then he dies as in giving hor her expiry date but nowadays they have this chance to actually extend ones life from 6 months or 1 year to some 2 years by taking continuos therapy needed for the treatment.",2
"Life,as we say,is more of a process than what it really means.As we are heading to more progressive and advanced generations,we are facing problems as well as fortunes in life.Very Similarly,our Life too,has become a bit lengthy in contrast.People have started a bit longer as we can say it.Earlier,People used to live too longer but then with increasing ages,life became shorter than one could imagine and the reason was unknown to anyone.But,gradually,the reasons became known and people became that intelligent too,to find out the solutions to those problems which could hamper our people.For example,once people used to die of diseases unaware of their knowledge about diseases,but now,our doctors have found out their ways to eradicate those diseases.Diseases are common nowadays bt we have found out how to deal with them.What could be more achievable than this?Even the most deadly and dreadful diseases have been shown their way out from this world.Nowadays,when people get a little problem,they head towards a doctor.Its not that only our doctors have earned this achievement,but we,our people too,have earned this,through our constant efforts.Efforts like,everybody has become conscious for own self as well as for others.People are way more interested in educating their children as well as others for the betterment of us.This is definitely an achievement for them as well as for us.Our ancestors used to say,In order to live longer,We need a Healthy mind as well as a Healthy Body.They would have been happier to see what fruits are have come to their planted trees,their younger generations.A healthy body refers to eating healthy,staying out of bad food habits and staying far from diseases too.And,a Heathy mind refers to bringing good thoughts into our mind.Because science says too,whatever we think happens to us.Thus,People are living longer now.We can just say,Think good,do good,be good and live long.",2
"These days nothing is impossible, all thanks to our technology and science which has made everything a small phenomenon.Living till the age of 90-95 is not a big deal or probably i should say if a person is alive till the age of 100 years also their is nothing suprising. But keeping in mind the kind of health facilities we have in india , it is a big problem indeed. we have huge number of patients but less beds and facilities in our government hospitals and affording a private hospital fees is no more a matter of joke. In old age a person IS faced with alot of health issues , thereby adding more financial burden to one's family as well as the society. government has increased the expenditure on health and development but india's popullation is huge. it is obvious we love our family memebers and it is difficult to see them going away from us in old age also. but if that person is occupying a bed in a goverment hospital that is not even morally correct may be beacuse of that someone could have led a better and healthy life. Moreover, nowadays youth dont want to live in a joint family. they send their parents in old age home and this is not even ethically correct.they should know what is their responsibilty towards their family and society at large. By saying all these i dont mean that in old age people should die but keeping the social and economic condition of our country in mind it is somehow posing a problem there are various reasons for such extended life span: 1. better standard of living 2. great medical facilties at doorsteps 3. people are more health conscious. everyone love their family so they try their level best taht they stay with them lifelong.they provide healthy environment to them , these days people go to gym or do yoga in such a small age. theyu want to keep themselves FIT AS FIDDLE.

Today government is also actively taking part in intriducing various health related programs..Movement like NRHM NATIONAL RURAL HEALTH MISSION is proved a boon for people living in rural areas.Now every doctor is to spend his first few years in far flung parts of villages. Previous years back there were no consideration about viruses but today every individual is aware of every harmful virus and regarding to that also about its prevention. Proper balanced diet is also one of factor of long living.Today people are very keen about their diet .They go for walks ,gyms and take proper counslling.Many family have their family personal docs.These doctors examine family members on weekly basis. The main cause of long living is literacy also.Today most of people are litereate and have full knowledge regarding diet and all . The opening of various small district and sub district hospitals also proved a boon for people in far flung areas where people cant approach citty hospitals.

But many of them still give precedence to have a good lifestyle for oneself and for the family.

"Life expectancy is a statistical average of the number of years a human lives, assuming mortality conditions during a given time period; this will vary according to region and era. In the Bronze and Iron Age life expectancy was 26; the 2010 world average was 67.2. In Swaziland the average is 49.42 years; in Japan it is 82.6 years. The combination of high infant mortality and deaths in young adulthood from accidents, epidemics, plagues, wars, and childbirth, particularly before modern medicine was widely available, significantly lowers the overall life expectancy. But for those who survive early hazards, a life expectancy of sixty or seventy would not be uncommon. For example, a society with a life expectancy of 40 may have few people dying at age 40: most will die before 30 years of age or after 55. In countries with high infant mortality rates, life expectancy at birth is highly sensitive to the rate of death in the first few years of life. Because of this sensitivity to infant mortality, simple life expectancy at age zero can be subjected to gross misinterpretation, leading one to believe that a population with a low overall life expectancy will necessarily have a small proportion of older people. For example, in a hypothetical stationary population in which half the population dies before the age of five, but everybody else dies at exactly 70 years old, the life expectancy at age zero will be about 36 years, while about 25% of the population will be between the ages of 50 and 70. Another measure, such as life expectancy at age 5, can be used to exclude the effect of infant mortality to provide a simple measure of overall mortality rates other than in early childhood - in the hypothetical population above, life expectancy at age 5 would be another 65 years. Aggregate population measures, such as the proportion of the population in various age groups, should also be used alongside individual-based measures like formal life expectancy when analyzing population structure and dynamics.",1
"Population is major problem of our country.India is a densely populated country and now-a-days people live longer.To maintain the population growth rate and death rate should be in a proper ratio.The main reason for this problem is the new medical faclities availble and the advanced medical treatments.Many fatal diseaeses like cancer have found cure.People now-a-days are more secured due to the new technologies.Risk in life has been reduced.Most of the people are getting their basic needs properly which is esssential to live a proper and longer life.Death rate has been decreased because now people are aware of all deadly diseases.Now everyone follows the moto ""PREVENTION IS BETTER THAN CURE"".People now-a-days are afraid of death and they do every possible thing to keep themself alive.People are greedy for their life. Medical facilities are advanced now that they can cure the heart diseases and pacemaker is available.Antidot for evry snake bite is available.Hospitals are availble immediately.Ambulance reaches the ruarl areas with less time.People are getting homely treatments so that a paralized person is able to live a life.The number of Doctors is increasing yearly.

"Recent studies depict that people nowadays live more than the ones who lived earlier.It has been an achievement for our country.The price of the life of a person is incompensatable.More people,more aspiring minds. What we want in our life is to be happy with our family,our loved ones.The phenomenonal causes which are leading to the rapid increase of lives of people reduces lack of physical,motivational and emotional sentiments when a person from a particular family is no more. The increase in people's physical and mental awareness,a hope to succeed with a healthy life with the family,factors contributing to the use of natural resources effeciently and without harming the environment is leading to live a happier,longer and an eco-friendly life.People now are very concerned about their health.They seek doctarial advice,whenever necessary.They use more natural products and remedies to live longer.Everone wants to live and for it,they want money.People work harder to live in this big world.Rich or poor,whoever it is,everyone is trying harder to survive.Even though there is no scarcity of poverty,but poors are also giving their best to earn money.The environment is not that clean but people nowadays are trying not to pollute it,atleast some people! People live longer because everyone is doing a bit to help it,make our environment a better place to live in.With the impact of higher education and open mindset,people are not only thinking about themselves but about others too.People are helping each other from coping from natural disasters.People contribute clothes,newspapers and other things by which they can help the needy ones.If a disaster arrives,then people's of a particular region are defintely effected a lot.But this nice gesture of people brings a hope to live life further.The impact cannot be reduced,but people may live longer. Stay healthier,stay longer!",1
"According to me, the main REASON FOR THE LONG SPAN OF THE PEOPLE TODAY is mainly due to the drastic improvement in the field of MEDICINE. Hence nowadays medicines are available for all the diseases and mainly there are also many precaution medicines which have the ability to prevent the diseases before they attacks a persons.normally when we take a survive by comparing the rate of life span of the previous generation and the present generation, it will be shocking to know the reality since our life span is decreasing for every generation. Before and all the life span of a human was 100years and later it turned to 90 and then 80, this was made as 70 soon and hardly now the life span of a person is nearly 60 and there are only few who have a long life span.This decrease in level of life span is due to the adoptation of new culture and which also includes their food culture which is totally not suitable for our national. so due to these reasons, man started to face nameless diseases and this leads to sooner death. This kind of health problems were started to be cured by the invention of new medicines and also some times by imported medicines. Apart from everything,sugar,blood pressure,kidney stone and heart attack are the major problems faced by this generation humans. since, all the diseases doesn't have medicines to be cured but they can partialy increase the life span of the humans. obesity is not considered as a disease where many advanced equipments are available which will suck out the unwanted calories and fat out but this precess is also a very costly process. if a person had got any fire injuries means they can immediately undergo plastic surgeries which may bring back their own face are a new one. Thus LIFE SPAN OF A PERSON IS JUDGED ONLY WITH THE MEDICINES AND IT IS ALSO BASED ON THE INDIVIDUALS PERCAUTIONS which they take for their long life.",1

There is wide range of demand for ayurvedic medicines rather than allopathy.Many prefer these because it prevents from attacking disease and it is slow as well as curing process.People have more medical facilities in allopathy also by importing medical instruments etc. People have a healthy diet routine followed by going to gyms,avoiding unhealthy food etc.This awareness is being brought because country like India has more health issues such as diabetics,BP,heart problems,neuro problems.To avoid all these health conscious is must. During vedic period and ancient times India had many medicines to cure .So they followed healthy diet,fresh food,fruits etc.Even our weather,nature also seems to have care on us like each season the fruits,flowers etc which are grown support Humans.Ex:In summer watermelons are famous becaouse they maintain the body temperature.The life expectancy rate is more in India as we are taking necessary steps control diseases such as vaccinations are provided for jaundice,typhoid. But still the country lacks in health issues because we do not have much medicinal benefits or diagnose the diseases.It is also stated that ayurveda,unani,siddha,yoga etc originated from India but he main problem is documentation of these medicines are low.So we should look forward for the healthy India and make the life expectancy rate more by research and development,creating more awareness to the health .",1

"We have heard that people of ancient ages lived longer. The reason is that they tried to live by nature, solely depending upon nature. We know the we cannot live without nature. Let us find the some of the reason why they were able to live longer,healthy and hygienically. I firmly believe that there is a creator of nature who has organized it perfectly to help humankind live healthier. So much of scientific inventions has deviated man away from nature. The food habits, the living style, dresses we wear. All of these has affected our health which reduces our lifetime. Our Body is like a machine that is designed to be systematic. God has created us like that by nature, It is very well organized. I am not a science student, but I can explain some of the basic things. Initially our digestive system is wondrous mechanism that is supernaturally created by God. As soon as we eat, when we intake food, it is ready to process the digestion. This is not by our order, it is done automatically, I believe it is the control of God. But as the science evolution started, we started developing varieties of colorful and delicious food, Our digestive system is loaded very much and that is the reason there is so much of diseases like Diabetes, obesity etc. The natural foods are harmless, the fruits, vegetables. They don't ruin our health. But these modern spicy Pizzas, burgers and so much. These are that that spoiled our body and reduced our lifetime. MAJOR REASONS ON FOOD THAT AFFECTS OUR LIFE PERIOD : * jun * contaminated foods. *Artificial attractions and colors that affects our body. We can live longer only if we only intake that is natural which has so much minerals without any side effects in future. I would rather live in a forest to eat fruits, vegetables which are moderate tasty and live longer than to devour modern foods that are spicy and delicious and die soon.",0
"Recollecting the times where our ancestors have stayed in, they had a far more healthier, stable, stress free life than people today. I would like to keep my stance as people lived longer before. the average age has been curtailed to 70 today. it is very disappointing that even with the advancement of technology and research in the field of pharmacy, health related issues and the disesases, people today don't live as long as before The lives have metamorphosed and every person is burdened with a lot of things. Education has taken a toll on student's life in today's world.a person judged on your degrees,marks, percentage, ranks. it defines how serious or committed a person is towards its work. Everyone around starts pestering a student and would expect him to study for hours. He no more can have an ecstatic carefree life, unlike our ancestors. Our ancestors would engage themselves by playing outdoor games like gilli danda, called cricket today, kabadi, sitolya and wouldn't be stuck in front of laptop working on their assignments or television watching sitcoms. the excessive competition has simply imbalanced a child's life and a person is put to stress from the very first stage of life. Reportedly, the number of suicides due to stress has increased dramatically. Stress is one of the major concerns today. it is one of the major reasons for living shorter today. one should strike a balance between education and co-curricular to stay healthy and fit. it is very important to work out and keep one's body fit to live longer. Further more, the introduction of junk food has ruined the diet of people today.

"As the questions reveals.The food habbits of them were entirely different from our generation. The food they had were very healthy when compared to us. The people who are living longer now are very rare in case and they are very uncountable. we have many phenomenon in nature some of them are being discussed briefly, due to the food habbits they had from their young age is the one reason for their longer living, they played very well and had many healthy habbits especially ladies had many exercising activities like cooking, griding, washing their cloths by themselves theey also did their household activities by themselves withput appointing any of the women for the work. nowadays people are being doing their works by appointing someone and they are doing their works by using machinaries. This is being very much difficult to live longer. People are being afected by many diseases in thier younger age itself.

We have to diet very healthy and do our daily workd by ourselves this is also a best solution to our longer live . There are certain peoples who have some of the heridity problems they have to be taken care properly and lead according to the doctors advisory. In this generation people like teenage are adicted to fast food like pizza, burger,oil fried items. These items, when we consume more will lead to many problems like obesity, hearthole, thyroid. we have to exercise for atleast an hour daily . This will be an good practise. Daily people should consume more food at morning, half of the meal at afternoon and very lesser food at night this avery good practise for a normal man. Daily drinking of green tea, eating of fresh fruits wiill also lead a longer life. These are the phenomenon on my point of view.",0

I did not think that people are living longer now because now the pollution is increases very high rate. The people are busy in their works and they did not care about their health. They did not walk so much as compare to the old people. Now the people only think about theirselves and they want more comfort and did not care their health. Pople are now become very selfish. CAUSES: 1. Laziness in the human beings. 2. Selfish and busy in their works. 3. People now requires only money and comfort.,0
